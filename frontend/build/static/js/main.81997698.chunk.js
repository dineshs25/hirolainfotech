Target Relevant Primary and Secondary Keywords</h4>","<p>Keyword research is the foundation of any good SEO strategy. If you know how to use keywords effectively, you can develop content that attracts more people to your website. The first step is to identify your page\u2019s primary and secondary keywords.</p>","<p>Your primary keyword is the main focus of your content. You only need to pick one primary keyword per page. It should be relevant to what your page\u2019s focus, your brand identity, your products, and your services. </p>","<p> Your secondary keywords support the main topic. You will probably have several of these. Often, they\u2019re more granular than the primary keyword and represent subtopics you\u2019re covering throughout an article. Try to include them naturally in your content, but don\u2019t force them if they don\u2019t fit. </p>","<p>You can use the Keyword Magic Tool to find your primary and secondary keywords.</p>","<p>First, enter a seed keyword representing the main topic you want to target. </p>","<img src='/images/blog/blog-1-img.png'/>","<p>Next, choose your primary keyword. Try and find one that\u2019s super relevant and aligns with your goals. For example, perhaps you want to write an educational blog post about travel, and you want to find a keyword with a lower difficulty.</p>","<p>Pay close attention to the Questions and Related Keywords sections to build your list of potential supporting keywords.             </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>2.

What\u2019s more, search engine algorithms, especially Google, are designed to sniff out unique content. Those who practise good SEO and publish trustworthy original content are likely to increase searches. </p>","<p>Ideally, your content should be comprehensive. That means the content you publish answers everything a user might want to know about that topic. Comprehensive pages help show search engines that you\u2019re an authority on that topic. </p>","<p>The SEO Content Template Tool can help you write more comprehensive content. It analyses high-ranking competitor content for your target keyword and tells you what attributes you should target to perform well. </p>","<p>Finally, evergreen content has long-term value, which will continue to be relevant and generate traffic over a long period. Inbound marketing is the gift that keeps on giving because it continues to produce results while your focus is elsewhere. </p>","<p>When creating evergreen content, think about what topics will bring long-term value to your readers without needing significant updates.

Use the Keyword Magic tool to identify relevant keywords with the search intent and SERP feature you want to target. </p>","<img src='/images/blog/blog-4-img.png'/>","<p>Next, search for that keyword yourself to see what type of content is currently featured. Make a note of what question the content answers and how it\u2019s written. You can also see top SERP results in your target location by selecting the triangle next to a keyword in the tool.</p>","<p>For example, is the snippet a bulleted list or a table? Is the information correct? What else ranks well? These observations will give you an idea of how to edit your content.</p>","<p>Now edit your content. </p>","<p>Make sure your content both asks and answers the target question in the snippet as clearly and concisely as possible. After all, studies show that a piece of content that asks a question is more likely to have a featured snippet. </p>","<p>Organize your page using heading and subheaders. If it makes sense for your page, try to use one of your subheaders to target your desired SERP feature. Headings and subheadings make it easy to understand or search your page, which can help improve your search ranking.</p>","<p>Finally, tighten up your page\u2019s copy. Try to use short, direct sentences (no more than 20 words) with language that isn\u2019t too complicated. And while you should try to avoid single-sentence paragraphs, you don\u2019t want them to be too long, either.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Optimize Your Page Title and Meta Description</h4>","<p>Your page title and meta description might be the first thing your audience ever sees. Users might decide whether to click or skip your page based on these alone.

Use Short, Descriptive URLs</h4>","<p>Improving your URL structure can significantly impact your on-page SEO with relatively little effort.

That\u2019s because many search engines can\u2019t process longer URLs and might rank you lower as a result.</li></ul>","<p>Of course, that\u2019s not the only way to generate backlinks. Here are a few other ideas:</p>","<ul><li>Offer to write a guest post for other outlets, particularly if you have an interesting infographic or something else to offer. </li><li>Reach out to publishers to cover any original research or data you\u2019ve put together for your on-site content. </li><li>Get listed in industry directories. You may need to join professional industry associations, networking groups, or business organizations, so you can further establish credibility.</li></ul>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>6. Generate Backlinks from High Site Authority Websites</h4>","<p>Backlinks, or external links leading to your site, are a critical ranking factor. Links from reputable sources can increase your site\u2019s authority and improve your SEO over time. You can acquire those backlinks through a process called link building.</p>","<p>But how do you know which backlink sources to target? It\u2019s simple: find out who your competitors get their backlinks from.

Remove Anything That Loads Slowly</h4>","<p>Page load time doesn\u2019t just impact user experience. It can also affect your SEO.

Ideally, these links should lead to useful, relevant information.</p>","<p>Internal links direct users to other pages on your site. They help search engine crawlers find your content and encourage users to stay on your site longer. For example, you could link between related blog posts to help your audience find more information on a topic they\u2019re researching without ever leaving your site. </p>","<p>External links are links that lead a user to another website.

Here are a few things to keep in mind: </p>","<ul><li>Size and Formatting: Make sure you\u2019re using the image size and file type that works best for your readers. If an image is too large, it could slow down your page. If the file type isn\u2019t supported, the image might not load at all.</li><li>Accessibility: Always include descriptive alt text for each image. Not only does this help make your site more accessible for screen readers, but it also creates opportunities to integrate more supporting keywords. Avoid embedding important text elements in your images unless there\u2019s another way to access them.</li><li>Context: Provide context for your images by placing them beside relevant text on your page. If possible, try to place your most important image near the top of the page.</li><li>Links: Create descriptive names and logical URL structures for all of your images. Not only does this help to optimize them for organic search, but it also makes it easier for others to share your pictures on their sites, potentially granting you backlinks.</li><li>Test: Always remember to test your pages on mobile and desktop. Users tend to search in Google Images from mobile more often than on desktop, so optimizing your images for mobile could have additional benefits.</li></ul>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>10. Conduct Regular Site Audits</h4>","<p>Performing regular site audits helps to ensure your site remains both functional and user-friendly.

The popularity of voice search both at home and on our phones has led to one of the most significant shifts in using keywords.</p>","<p>Think about it. When we type a search into Google, we phrase it differently than when we use Alexa for information. For example, a person looking for the nearest Indian restaurant might type \u201cIndian restaurant Raleigh\u201d into Google, but might ask Cortana, \u201cwhere is the closest Indian restaurant\u201d. When writing content, choose your keywords based on the questions people may ask when using Siri or Alexa.

If they want to be notified of special offers or information, consumers must keep up with their favorite profiles. Your followers will follow you if you provide a behind-the scenes look, discount code or limited edition product via Stories. As long as you deliver, they will love your updates.</p>","<p>These are some simple ideas to add value to your social media posts:</p>","<ul><li>Find customer content that your business has tagged in and then repost it onto Your Stories</li><li>Livestream video to people who couldn\u2019t view it live</li><li>Use polls, questions and quizzes as a way to connect with viewers and encourage them to participate.</li><li>Make simple animations or short videos showing your product/service in action</li></ul>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Social Media Contests Media Contests</h4>","<p>Contests on social media can be a great way to get your customers involved and engage them.

Technology advances can allow you to tap into these feelings through virtual and augmented realities experiences.</p>","<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg presented the new virtual reality platform Spaces to the globe by Virtually touring a hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. Although this was poor PR, it is a good example of digital marketing\u2019s future direction in offering meaningful and deep experiences. Brands are now offering tours of their facilities and offering interactive 3D models to allow users to examine the products. Smaller businesses will be able to take advantage of AR/VR technology as it becomes easier to access.</p>","<p>Major companies such as IKEA are already using AR.

Content Marketing</h4>","<p>Marketing automation, email marketing and video have all been discussed, so it is no surprise that content marketing will not be going away anytime soon. Two-fold benefits can be derived from content marketing:</p>","<p>To increase your search engine ranking, you can use high-quality content with strategic keyword usage and to attract more traffic from a relevant audience.</p>","<p>Your valuable information helps you stand out as an authority and builds trust.</p>","<p>A few factors are key to content marketing success. These include knowing and leveraging keywords that you want to rank for, creating content that is relevant to every stage of your sales funnel, from new customers to loyal customers, as well as building engagement to build brand ambassadors by sharing your content.</p>","<p>These are some of the most powerful forms of content marketing that can help you achieve your goals:</p>","<p>Blog posts are used to share news and information about your company.</p>","<p>You can now create service pages to help you target keywords and get a better look at your business.</p>","<p>Images and videos to create interest</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>FAQ</h4>","<p>To keep customers informed and continue engagement, email newsletters are a great way to stay in touch.</p>","<p>You can use case studies to prove your success.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>2.Page Speed</h4>","<p>Slow-loading pages are the #1 reason that users abandon a website within one minute of landing. Also known as the bounce rate, even a few seconds delay in loading a page can adversely affect your conversion.</p>","<p>You can speed up page loading times quite easily, which is the good news. Optimize your images. Make sure you don\u2019t have large files. If they do exist, reduce them to less than 100KB.</p>","<p>Reduce the number of redirects that are internal to your site. This includes redirect chains that have to go through multiple redirects before they land on the correct URL. These can be reduced to increase your authority in Google as well as your page load speed (both positive things).</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>3.User-generated content (UGC).</h4>","<p>User-generated content, when properly moderated and curated, can be a powerful tool on your website for both SEO and user experience.</p>","<p>User-generated content (UGC), doesn\u2019t need to be complex or extensive. It can be as simple as a review of a product on your website, a comment on an article on the blog, or a section in which people can ask questions and receive the answers. Let\u2019s first look at the benefits.</p>","<p><strong>Content Updates \u2013 </strong>Google loves content updates. Every time a question, comment or review is made, the content is updated.</p>","<p><strong>Longer content \u2013</strong>Search engine rankings can be improved by having more content. This is because search engines assume that more content equals a comprehensive resource. Although product descriptions may be brief, customer reviews can increase SEO by adding length.</p>","<p><strong>Content uniqueness \u2013 </strong>Copying content can harm SEO. However, product descriptions are one example of how you can make your product stand apart from thousands of other similar products. This is especially true if you use the copy provided by the manufacturer. Your search engine ranking can be boosted by user reviews and comments.</p>","<p>It is important to ensure that you are moderating user-generated content. You can set up certain settings on your blog to reduce spam, stop link postings and filter comments that contain specific words. However, it is possible to manually moderate your UGC.

If the page linking to you has a high page authority, then that PA will be shared with your page. This helps Google determine the ranking for your webpage. </p>","<p>For an in-depth guide to backlinking, check out Semrush\u2019s recent piece on link building for SEO.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Why Is Link Building Important?</h4>","<p>In the world of SEO, backlinks can be considered recommendations from an outside party. A backlink from a reputable website indicates what you\u2019re presenting on your website is of good value. </p>","<p>If a website with a high ranking in a certain area of expertise links back to you, that is a massive vote of confidence for your website, which can encourage search engines to believe in your content too.</p>","<p>When done right, link building services can contribute to forecast remarkable growth in organic traffic. Your site could also benefit from targeted referral traffic from these external 3rd party sites backlinking to you. </p>","<p>Think of your behaviour when reading an article. If there is a reference to another article, or a suggested link to follow to find out more, would you follow that link? </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Link Building Best Practices</h4>","<p>Link building is a complex job with big rewards. However, if done the wrong way you can be penalised by Google. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Good Ways to Acquire Backlinks</h4>","<h4>The Skyscraper Technique</h4>","<p>1. Find a piece of content in your industry or field of expertise that is performing well. The easiest way is to use Google and look at the top 3 search results.</p>","<p>2. Create a piece of content that is more current or helpful than the top 3 search results. Do more with your content than what is already there.</p>","<p>3. Promote your content. If you have mentioned people or websites in your article, reach out to them, tell them, and have them link to your content as a reciprocal gesture.</p>","<p>You can also contact industry websites or forums focused on the topic you\u2019re discussing with your content. Share your content with them and let them know it\u2019s more updated or current. </p>","<p>The Skyscraper technique is just one technique described in <a href='https://www.semrush.com/'>Semrush\u2019s</a> ,guide to acquiring backlinks.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>WHelping out a Journalist</h4>","<p>You can use the HARO (Help A Reporter Out) site to contact journalists in search of experts on a specific topic. Journalists often reach out to experts for quotes or statements for their articles. If you can help a reporter out, you could earn a powerful backlink to your website or content.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Broken Link Building </h4>","<p>This is a technique where you find broken links on other websites and suggest they can fix their broken link by linking to your content instead.</p>","<p>Click through to learn more about the broken link building technique.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Publish \u201cUltimate Guides\u201d</h4>","<p>Your \u201cUltimate Guides\u201d need to be hefty with a big word count and with a lot of valuable information. You don\u2019t want to leave anything on the cutting room floor. Try to include as much useful information as possible, so your readers consider you a reputable source.</p>","<p>Including a downloadable PDF also helps with this strategy. When people are writing about your targeted topic on their websites, they\u2019ll likely write about and link to your guide for readers who want more detail. Being able to download your guide to read later adds to the user experience.</p>","<h2 class='title mb--30'>Bad Ways to Acquire Backlinks</h2>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don\u2019t Buy Links</h4>","<p>This tactic of buying links may have worked in the early 2000s, but it is no longer an effective strategy.</p>","<p>Buying links doesn\u2019t guarantee the links will be helpful or relevant to your site. A large swathe of irrelevant links pointing to your site will likely earn a penalization from Google.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don\u2019t Automate Link Generation</h4>","<p>This spammy technique will net you very few responses. People that receive emails asking for backlinks will know it\u2019s auto-generated, and your email will likely end up in their spam or trash folder. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don\u2019t Comment on Blogs Purely for Links</h4>","<p>Build your reputation as a figure of authority, but don\u2019t push your website as the best place to get all the answers.

If you\u2019re only getting links to your homepage Google might consider it spam and won\u2019t consider these backlinks when ranking you.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don\u2019t Recycle Your Content on Different Pages</h4>","<p>While guest blogging is a good idea for backlinking, if you simply copy your content to other sites, you run the risk of becoming a victim to \u2018duplicate content.\u2019 </p>","<p>Duplicate content dilutes the potential of both pieces of content, as Google has to eventually choose between the two when deciding what to rank. </p>","<h2 class='title mb--30'>5 things to Consider when Choosing a Link-Building Service</h2>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>1. Site Reputation & Link Quality</h4>","<p>To determine reputation, you could look to a site\u2019s authority score, which forecasts how well a website will rank on a SERP. Scores are ranked on a scale of 1\u2013100. The higher the score, the higher the likelihood of the page ranking high in Google\u2019s SERP.</p>","<p>Another factor to consider when it comes to backlinks is niche relevance. If websites in a similar niche as yours backlink to you, then your ranking will benefit. Receiving a backlink from a website similar to yours but not as closely related doesn\u2019t have that strong of an impact. </p>","<p>Niche relevance also helps Google understand what your site is about. Backlinks from niched sites can further your authority in that niche and heighten the likelihood your site is returned for a user\u2019s intent.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>2. Automation Process</h4>","<p>As mentioned above, automated emails can feel impersonal and won\u2019t net as many positive returns as a custom email. Of course, you can customise some templates to make the process of emailing more efficient.</p>","<p>The flip side to automation is scheduling and following up on leads and link requests. If you\u2019ve spent the time creating content and then have a service send out link requests, you need to follow up.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>3. Service Cost</h4>","<p>If a service costs more, will it do more for you? Are you paying for a large agency? Does it feel like good value to you?</p>","<p>Feel free to compare different services to see if there are similarities in pricing and features.</p>","<p>What will be the return on investment? Do you want a guaranteed amount of links or quality of links?</p>","<p>Do you get monthly reports as part of your investment? Are you given any visibility into the process as part of your investment? What return will you be happy with?</p>","<p>The better the backlink, the better your potential search result. How this translates to revenue depends on your website and where the link lands. A financial ROI may be difficult to measure.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>4. What Is the Backlink Profile of the Service?</h4>","<p>This metric can be the proof in the pudding. If the backlink service you\u2019re investigating has a good backlink profile and other sites point to them as masters in their craft, then excellent \u2014 they know what they\u2019re doing.</p>","<p>However, if the backlink service you\u2019re checking out has a poor backlink profile, you might wonder about their ability to earn backlinks for your website as well.</p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>5. Reviews</h4>","<p>What are other clients saying about this service? When you search for backlink provider reviews, what is the consensus about the service?</p>","<p>Consider the credibility and relevance of those people giving the reviews. Are those reviews on forums or a social media channel randomly linking to a backlink service? Is it a review on a reputable site linking to the 10 best link-building services?</p>","<p>Whose opinion would you trust?</p>"],features_img:["/images/blog/blog-8.png","/images/blog/blog-9.png"],author_name:"Hirola Infotech Solutions ",author_avatar:"images/logo-2.svg",author_para:"Email is a crucial channel in any marketing mix, and never has this been truer than for today\u2019s entrepreneur.

That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to stay in touch with trends and understand what Google will be throwing at you in the coming years.

To get more new and organic traffic, you need to rank on the first page of the search engines. And that\u2019s where you require SEO. Though, SEO is steadily growing. We have made a list of emerging trends in SEO that will come in handy for your business to stay on top of the search engines without any hindrances. They are as follows:",body:["<h2 class='title mb--30'>Emerging Trends in SEO:</h2>","<p class='title mb--30'>1) Core web vitals and Page speed:</p>","<p>Earlier in 2020, Google announced three new metrics, such as core web vitals. It is used for measuring the consumer experience as Largest contentful paint (loading), First input delay (interactivity) and Cumulative layout shift (stability). All of these three SEO metrics are related to one thing that is the Page speed. How does the page load, how stable it is, and how soon it gets interactive. It means that page speed will play a crucial role in ranking your website, and you must pay attention to it. </p>","<p>It was applied to assure a great customer experience, and the customer should not leave the page due to a bad experience. It means that you have to pay heavy consideration to rank on search engines.  </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>2) Customer focus:</h4>","<p>The approach towards a successful SEO strategy is that what is best for your customers is best for SEO. Google wants to give its customers the most satisfying user experience. Whenever the user searches for something, he/she should get the relevant searches. The user must feel satisfied, and if they are satisfied, they will come next time searching for you.  </p>","<p>Put yourself in your user\u2019s shoes and ask yourself if the content that you were looking for in the website is valuable, informational, and trusting, then won\u2019t you be coming back on that website? Of course, you will.  </p>","<p>You must add something useful and relevant for your users so that they keep on coming back to you. It will help you in getting loyal users to your website constantly. It will further help in ranking also. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>3) Mobile SEO:</h4>","<p>The most stunning trend nowadays is mobile SEO. You must make sure that the website you have made is mobile friendly. Most people make most of their exploring by mobile phones. Google will eventually begin to focus on mobile SEO as compared to desktop/computer SEO. Because Google focuses on users\u2019 needs. The majority of people explore search engines using their mobile phones. So your rankings might go abysmal. </p>","<p>If you\u2019re performing SEO for desktops/computers and not for mobile phones, undoubtedly, your desktop/computer ranking may be increasing, but your mobile ranking could be wretched. Concentrating on mobile SEO is also crucial and is simply continuing to enhance. So, it\u2019s high time to start working on mobile SEO as well. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>4) Search intent:</h4>","<p>When you write a new piece of content for your website, you must be concentrating more on the search engine results page (SERP) rather than google search console, semrush or any other tool. The search engine page will show you what your audience is looking for more. Google will tell you your users\u2019 searching intent. It will give you an idea of what content you must create and not create. It will tell you what your customers are hunting for, and you must try to write content that they are steadily looking for. By approaching those needs you get a chance to increase your conversion rate. The purpose of SEO is not just to get higher traffic to your website. It should also specialise in increasing leads and profits for your business.  </p>","<p>If you don\u2019t consider your audience search intent, there is a high possibility that you will fall behind the rankings of search engines.  </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>5) Change quickly:</h4>","<p>The field of SEO is changing persistently. Google updates its algorithms time-to-time, and you must keep in touch with those changes to stay in the competition. If you are not able to change with time and adapt to these changes quickly, you fall out of the competition. In the coming years, you must think differently to stay at the top and in competition. You will have to plan for more strategic SEO implementation keeping in mind your audience search intent. You can use tools, google trends to see what customers are looking for and implement your strategies focusing on them. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>6) Voice search:</h4>","<p>Voice searching undoubtedly is going to transform the way people interact with search engines. Most people search using voice search features. Sometimes, the problems that customers are looking for are big, and you don\u2019t feel like typing for it. This is where voice search technology is beneficial. You can just ask your query instead of typing it and get instant results. Voice search is evolving with time, and it will continue to grow in the coming years as well. It will play an important role in ranking search engines. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>7) <a href='https://hirolainfotech.com/video-marketing/'>Video marketing:</a></h4>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>7) Video marketing:</h4>","<p>Youtube after Google is the second most popular used search engine network. It is used by a population of 1 billion people. So, if you aren\u2019t into video marketing, it is time to start using it. You can start by creating a youtube channel, add a name to your page and description. The description should not be too long. It should be enough that it covers your business services. You can upload videos with enchanting titles. You should add keywords in all the titles and descriptions so that it ranks fast </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>8) Content quality:</h4>","<p>Quality plays an important role in content marketing. You must add content that is relevant and informational for the users. It should not be plagiarised. It should be within the limits stated by google to rank it. You must write original and unique content for your website. </p>","<p>You should add content to your website that stays relevant even in future. You can add some educational and inspirational blogs and articles that stay in trend even after a long time. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>9) Keyword marketing:</h4>","<p>Keyword marketing is an essential element of SEO. It helps in getting your website ranked faster. Without targeting any keyword, it is tough to rank your website. You must use keywords in your titles, descriptions, image tags, URLs, heading, etc. Keywords help the audience to find their queries easily on the search engines. They also tell you about what your audience is looking and searching for. You must pick the right keywords to rank effectively on the search engines. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Conclusion:</h4>","<p>These are the emerging trends in SEO. Well, that\u2019s a great list of SEO trends that can be a complete game-changer for your business. Perform these trends and get a premium edge over your competitors.  It might consume a lot of time to execute all of them but once when you do it. You will start to feel the difference. You will begin to see growth in your website traffic, better website ranking, more conversions and click rate. </p>","<p>No Idea on how to grow your website visibility and growth?

Despite this, proving the value of your content to your bosses and peers is another task entirely.",body:["<h4 class='title mb--30'>Calculating ROI</h4>","<p>In plain terms, to calculate ROI, subtract the spend from the return, then divide the return by the amount spent. </p>","<p>ROI = current value of investment minus cost of investment divided by cost of investment. </p>","<p>This will give you a decimal that can be expressed as a percentage (in this case, 100%). You\u2019ll already know this but if it\u2019s a positive number, well done, your activity drove more money than you spent. If it\u2019s negative, it probably wasn\u2019t worth the effort. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>The underlying stats</h4>","<p>The actual formula for ROI is relatively straightforward. Adding up how much you spend should also be simple, providing you have kept accurate records. Add up everything from time spent, salaries paid, agency fees, media spend, design costs and anything else you can think of for the most accurate reflection. </p>","<p>The most difficult part with content marketing is putting a figure on the return. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Lead generation</h4>","<p>Identifying the return is easier for some types of content over others. If your content is behind a lead-generation form that requires users to enter their details before accessing the file, you\u2019re in luck. Evaluating the amount of business it drove is as simple as matching the lead value to the downloads. It may be worth doing this with potential lead value (whether it was won or lost) and actual sales value. This way, you can prove the worth of your content \u2013 it\u2019s up to the sales team to close the lead. </p>","<p>You can see this method in action with Hubspot\u2019s Complete Collection of Content Creation Templates. If you want to download them, you have to tell Hubspot who you are, and you can bet they\u2019ll get in contact afterwards. If your lead-generation form is connected to your customer database \u2013 like Hubspot\u2019s will be \u2013 then this process is even more simple. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Alternative ways of evaluating return</h4>","<p>For other types of content, it\u2019s less straightforward. Blogs, videos, articles, guest posts, infographics, case studies and other pieces of content will all contribute to sales in various ways without getting that final conversion. To find the ROI for these, you\u2019ll have to be more creative as there are many methods: </p>","<ul><li>Engagement For some, the amount of engagement a page drives is a good indicator of its value. A higher number of page views, time on site and a lower bounce rate are all good indicators of engagement. The more engaged your users are, the more likely they are to get in touch or buy from you.</li><li>SEO performance Your content may be extremely valuable at improving your search rankings and driving visits \u2013 and, ultimately, sales \u2013 for your site. To work out the return of individual pages or pieces of content, you can work out the page views as a percentage of total page views, and extrapolate this to the total amount of business driven by natural search. This can also apply to sections of your site, for example your blog.</li><li>Backlinks Backlinks are important for good SEO performance. If backlinks are one of your goals, they can be used to determine the value of content. The number of backlinks is important, but the quality of the sites linking to you can be even more so.</li><li>Social media metrics Content is the lifeblood of successful social media, so the amount of business coming from social links is often a good indicator of successful content. Keeping track of likes, shares and views of different posts is also a good demonstration of the value of different content.</li></ul>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Attribution models in Google Analytics</h4>","<p>There are many ways of attributing the value of sales you have made to the marketing efforts that drove them. It\u2019s a complex journey, because users move between channels over a significant period of time before they make their purchase. </p>","<p>Google Analytics is a great free tool that is helpful when evaluating the return of content. Its Page Value metric puts a financial figure against each page based on the contribution it makes to sales. The higher the number, the higher the value. </p>","<p>The tool also allows you to look at your content marketing performance using different attribution models, providing you have <a href='https://hirolainfotech.com/e-commerce-web-development/'>e-commerce</a> tracking set up. There are the standard models: first click, last click, time decay and linear. There is also the option to create a custom model.

So, an agency\u2019s success depends largely on its capacity to build a talented writing team \u2013 and this is not as easy as it seems.",body:["<p>Right now, it appears as if there are too many copywriting jobs than there are writers available to do them. This brings two questions to mind: is it possible to strike a balance, and how? </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Demand for the Best Writing Talent</h4>","<p>It\u2019s easy to understand why there is a huge demand for writing talent. Virtually all types of B2B marketing requires B2B content at one point or the other. Anytime your content is compared to that of a competitor, having a writer on your team who can capture the attention of your readers gives you a great advantage. </p>","<p>Obviously, there are upsides to having in-house copywriters, especially for companies with heavy workloads. Firstly, being able to call on the talents at your disposal without having to wait until a freelancer is free, can be very beneficial. Secondly, there are positive cost implications because in-house B2B content writers earn less than the average copywriter. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Why is there a shortage of writers?</h4>","<p>The top brands and B2B agencies have a plethora of content jobs available, but let\u2019s take a look at why the best writers aren\u2019t always queuing up to take them. </p>","<ul><li>thB2B copywriting can be difficult B2B writing is not easy. If you\u2019re looking for a writer who wants to write about B2B topics such as IP law and insurance software, you\u2019ll need to find someone with a good grasp of the subject, understand how it ties in with the business side of things, and be a good-enough writer to create compelling copy. This is a tough ask for a lot of people.ree</li><li>They don\u2019t need the work These days, good freelancers are well paid. So, it isn\u2019t surprising to find that a freelancer you\u2019re offering a job to already earns more than you\u2019re willing to pay. And to top it off, as a freelancer they get to work in the comfort of their home, whenever they want. So, why would they want to leave all that comfort just to take a B2B copywriting job in an office? The incentives are not always enough.</li></ul>","<p>How can you fix this problem? By hiring your own B2B copywriters and training them to your company\u2019s high standards.  </p>","<p>A B2B copywriter that knows their subject matter will not just come out of nowhere, ready-made to work for you. Once you\u2019re able to recognise this, you\u2019ll know you have just a few options. You can continue hiring freelancers, engage the services of a <A href='https://hirolainfotech.com/content-marketing/'> B2B copywriting agency</a>, employ trainee writers and train them, and improve the skills of your current marketing team through training. All these options come with their own problems. </p>","<p>To build a powerful team of copywriters, however, growing your own team is a solid option. All it needs is identifying people with the right attitude, as well as interest/understanding of tech or business, then dedicating the time to teach and mentor them until they reach the required standard. </p>","<p>This approach needs patience, plenty of coaching, and comprehensive feedback. As such, it\u2019s a long-term strategy, and as time goes on, you\u2019ll start to reap the rewards of your efforts in mentorship, training, and investment. </p>","<p>Also, if a member of your marketing team has a flair for writing, you could structure a development program for them which would involve copywriting training so they can help out with the writing workload. One other advantage of this type of training is that they can review content that has been outsourced to freelance writers. </p>","<p>Alternatively, for reliable and quick results, an expert copywriting agency is the best option. </p>","<p>One thing you can be sure of is that you\u2019ll be getting the best copywriters, which is exactly what B2B marketing requires. Even if you implement all the data, technology, automation, and personalisation techniques, you won\u2019t be making any positive impact if you\u2019re creating content that your readers find poor quality. </p>","<p>If you would like to find out how our B2B copywriters services could be of benefit to your business, feel free to get in touch with us today. </p>"],features_img:["/images/blog/blog-8.png","/images/blog/blog-9.png"],author_name:"Hirola Infotech Solutions ",author_avatar:"images/logo-2.svg",author_para:"Email is a crucial channel in any marketing mix, and never has this been truer than for today\u2019s entrepreneur.

Now, it\u2019s time to give you some answers! </p>","<p>A question on the tip of many people\u2019s lips is: what\u2019s the difference between <a href='https://hirolainfotech.com/content-marketing/'>content writing</a> and copywriting? </p>","<p>If you\u2019re reading this article, you\u2019ve already taken the first step toward dismantling the jargon and figuring out what copywriting is all about. Now, it\u2019s time to give you some answers! </p>","<p>A question on the tip of many people\u2019s lips is: what\u2019s the difference between content writing and copywriting? </p>","<p>Generally, a content writer creates content like blog posts and articles. This forms part of a content marketing strategy to raise awareness for a brand, business, or product. Although the end goal is to sell, it\u2019s a much less direct approach. </p>","<p>In case you\u2019re interested, we have a content writing service, too. </p>","<p>Copywriters try to prompt buyers to take action and make a purchase straightaway. They might craft website pages, emails, or other kinds of promotional materials. To achieve success, it\u2019s essential to study the arts of convincing and persuasion. </p>","<p>There\u2019s a lot of overlap between the two fields. Blog posts often contain a call to action (CTA) that prompts the reader to buy something, for instance. </p>","<p>Don\u2019t get too hung up about the labels \u2013 just focus on learning to write in a way that gets the results you want. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Master the basics of grammar</h4>","<p>The natural follow-up question is: how can I learn to improve my copywriting? Before you perfect your persuasion skills, you need to get your basic grammar skills up to scratch. Grammarly is the most popular piece of grammar-checking software available, and it has a free version. ProWritingAid and HemingwayApp are two alternatives. </p>","<p>Whichever you use, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a focus on cutting out unnecessary words and making your writing as simple as possible. After using them for a few weeks, you might be surprised how many redundant words and phrases you\u2019ve been using in your writing. </p>","<p>If you still don\u2019t feel confident in your writing or grammar skills, why not ask for a second opinion? Asking a friend or relative to proofread your work might sound daunting, but it will help you take huge strides in improving your writing </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Study copywriting tools and resources</h4>","<p>Once you\u2019ve mastered the basics of writing well, you should start thinking about your SEO strategy. It\u2019s no use writing a fantastic piece of copy if it ranks so low on the search engine that nobody sees it. </p>","<p>One tool we can\u2019t recommend enough is WordCounter. Don\u2019t be fooled by the name \u2013 it does far more than just count how many words you\u2019re using. </p>","<p>This website also recommends keywords based on your content and lets you know if you need to include more of them. This is essential for letting Google know what you\u2019re writing about. </p>","<p>Although it\u2019s generally not a good idea to work backwards with your SEO strategy, this is a less intimidating way to start than carrying out keyword research before writing. </p>","<p>Like all serious writers will tell you, you can\u2019t improve your writing unless you read. Even if you think you don\u2019t have the time, it\u2019s time to make it a priority. Amongst the most acclaimed books on copywriting are The Boron Letters by Gary C Halbert, Ogilvy On Advertising by David Ogilvy, and Triggers by Joe Sugarman. They all contain useful copywriting examples, too. </p>","<p>Of course, there are many more. As you\u2019ll soon see, inspiration could strike you in strange places. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Take notes from inspiring writers</h4>","<p>Reading books about copywriting and related topics is useful, but it\u2019s not the only way to improve your copy. </p>","<p>Becoming a truly great writer is all about developing flair and your own voice. That involves experimenting with your writing and consuming many types of content. </p>","<p>Comedy, memoirs, and young adult fiction are all on the table. Maybe reading Charles Dickens helps you add some flow into your writing and trying some humour teaches you to be less formal and rigid. </p>","<p>Whatever you\u2019re reading, take notes and think about how you can learn from it. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don\u2019t hold back with your editing process</h4>","<p>Many people struggle with editing, but let\u2019s get real \u2013 you can\u2019t be a good writer without it. This is true of all kinds of writing, but you have to be especially ruthless with your copy. If your first sentence doesn\u2019t hook the reader in immediately, you can kiss goodbye to your sales. </p>","<p>If you\u2019re struggling, a common tip is to read your content out loud. It might seem tedious, and you might feel slightly crazy doing it at first, but it\u2019s one of the best ways to figure out if something sounds good. </p>","<p>Copywriting is a difficult skill. You can\u2019t just pick it up overnight after reading a book or watching a few videos. If you truly want to improve, you have to make a long-term commitment to mastering your craft. </p>","<p>If you already have a business or an idea and you need to start making sales now, you might not feel you can afford to wait that long. That\u2019s okay, too. A great alternative is to use a copywriting service that\u2019s already put in the time and can do the work for you.

It\u2019s important that you know what your brand identity is and what you want it to be. If you don\u2019t, how is anyone else supposed to know? You\u2019re going to have a tough time generating brand awareness if you lack a strong brand identity through our Branding Services. The following are a few steps that you should take to establish your brand identity:</p>","<ol><li><h5>Identify your mission</h5><p>What was the reason you established your company in the first place? What is your company\u2019s goal? Consumers want to know what your mission is (and they don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s \u201cto make a profit\u201d) and it will reflect who you are as a company.</p></li><li><h5>Establish your unique value proposition</h5><p>Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors. It\u2019s a statement of how your offer benefits your customers, how you will meet the needs of your customers, and what makes your offer unique. Every marketing campaign you run should align with your unique value proposition.</p></li><li><h5>Create your brand\u2019s visual identity</h5><p>The visual elements of your brand certainly factor into your brand identity. Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well.</p></li><li><h5>Increase brand recognition</h5><p>It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses. You\u2019ll want to generate awareness of your brand to do this through a variety of marketing efforts, such as building a website that emphasises your mission and unique value proposition, creating content that\u2019s optimised for SEO, using social media to engage with consumers and to post your content, and more. It\u2019s also vital that you make sure your mission, unique value proposition, and visual identity are consistent across all platforms. If it\u2019s not, it will end up hurting your brand identity.</p></li></ol>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Brand Culture</h4>","<p>Brand culture refers to your company\u2019s core values and how you set an example for those values with our Branding Services. Businesses have always emphasised certain values; however, those values were often things like \u201creliability\u201d or \u201chonesty.\u201d Values that are more equivalent to basic ethics. While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example. They have taken strong social positions by running commercials backing Colin Kaepernick and recently touting the importance of the women\u2019s U.S. soccer team\u2019s World Cup win. These are branding efforts touting their championing of equality, which has become a part of their brand culture. The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture: </p>","<ol><li><h5>Define your values</h5><p>Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers.</p></li><li><h5>Spread awareness of your values</h5><p>Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well.</p></li><li><h5>Ensure your company reflects your values</h5><p>There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company.                    </p></li></ol>"],bodyTwo:["<h4 class='title mb--30'>Brand Image</h4>","<p>Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service. Keeping that in mind, the following are a few ways to build and maintain a positive brand image: </p>","<ol><li><h5>Spread your message via PR</h5><p>Use public relations to spread your key messages as well as relevant news concerning your company. You can do this through news outlets, trade publications, and even online blogs. Public relations will help you raise awareness of your brand and what you\u2019re doing, thereby helping to improve your brand image.</p><li><h5>Establish a social presence</h5><p>Social media is an incredibly effective way to build your brand image, whether it\u2019s by sharing content with consumers, keeping consumers up to date on the latest news and product launches, spreading awareness of your message, and engaging with consumers on a personal level. In fact, you can even use social media to address negative comments. It\u2019s a good way to repair potential damage done to your brand image as a result of a poor customer experience by showing that you care and trying to correct the situation.</p><li><h5>Create high-quality content</h5><p>Content will help to increase brand awareness by bringing in more web traffic. However, it can also help to build your brand authority. By publishing content that is relevant to your company and to your audience (and that\u2019s of high quality), you\u2019ll become a trustworthy source of information, which \u2014 in turn \u2014 will help improve your reputation and increase brand trust.</p></ol>","<p>A brand that is positive will contribute to steady growth in referrals, sales and retention of customers. Every marketing campaign begins by identifying the customers you want to reach, creating an identity, creating the mission statement or vision statement, describing the USP and positioning it against other brands and highlighting the advantages of the brand. </p>","<h4 class='title mb--30'>Brand Personality</h4>","<p>Your brand personality refers to the human characteristics that your company has. Developing a brand personality is vital to connecting with your audience on an emotional level and for making your brand relatable. Because of this, make sure that you use the following tips to develop your brand personality: </p>","<ol><li><h5>Learn who your audience is</h5><p>Understanding your audience is something that you need to do from the very beginning. It\u2019s an important step in building your brand identity as well. However, it\u2019s particularly important when it comes to developing your brand personality. The way you present yourself and the way that you communicate should reflect not only who the audience is but what they expect. For example, if you have a younger audience, then a dry, formal tone may not resonate with them. However, if your audience is older, using younger slang and current pop culture references may go over their heads.</></li><li><h5>Engage with your audience</h5><p>While you can get your personality across in the content you write, it\u2019s easier to do through engaging with people. It\u2019s why using social media is so important. Your entire audience sees your interactions and it helps establish your personality a certain way. For example, Wendy\u2019s has a reputation for having a playful personality because of their use of humor and the pretend feuds that they get into with other brands on Twitter. </></li><li><h5>Be consistent in tone</h5><p>If you\u2019re going to be funny and informal on one platform, you need to make sure that personality carries over to all of the other platforms you use, both online and offline. If you\u2019re inconsistent, it will hurt your ability to develop a cohesive brand personality, which will only confuse your audience.</></li></ol>","<p>These are the four main brand components that you will need to address when developing your brand strategy. A strong brand requires a strong brand identity, brand image, brand culture, and brand personality. Implementing a successful brand strategy that develops all four of these components increases brand trust, loyalty, and awareness. </p>","<p>We are Completely Experts in Brand Services.

The following are a few steps that you should take to establish your brand identity:"},{id:"2",title:"Identify your mission",description:"What was the reason you established your company in the first place? What is your company\u2019s goal? Consumers want to know what your mission is (and they don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s \u201cto make a profit\u201d) and it will reflect who you are as a company."},{id:"3",title:"Establish your unique value proposition",description:"Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors.

Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses.

While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example.

It\u2019s common for people to want their applications to work across web and mobile devices, so we use development frameworks such as React and React native that enable us to quickly support both platforms."},{id:"5",title:"Do you build web applications too?",description:"Yes, in fact nearly every mobile app that we build also needs a web based application behind the scenes to drive it. Ever logged into an app? There is a web server in the background, serving the app with data that is checking whether you have permission to log in, or not"},{id:"6",title:"How do you make sure you build what I want, and don\u2019t get it wrong?",description:"We don\u2019t just blindly begin building your requirements; we start by having a meeting to understanding the commercial factors that are driving the need for your project. We want to get to a position very quickly where we know enough to challenge you on the assumptions you\u2019ve made about the features you require.  Once we understand your business, we go to lots of effort at the start of a project to work with you, and scope out your requirements in detail. You don\u2019t just want us to tell you that we understand your project, we need to prove it to you. This is why we will often create a 10+ page requirements specification, with wireframes where appropriate, before we design a single pixel, or write a line of code."},{id:"7",title:"Will I own the source code?",description:"Yes, you will be assigned appropriate copyright or licence rights for the bespoke code that we write for your project. We are transparent with intellectual property rights, and you will have the opportunity to review our code ownership terms before the project begins."},{id:"8",title:"Do you provide ongoing support, maintenance and updates?",description:"Yes, we offer the option to engage us on an ad-hoc basis for support, or have monthly retainer options should you require a more consistent and reliable level of service.Ad-hoc support can work for projects that need minimal support as to avoid the need for fixed ongoing monthly costs. However, this can be at the expense of responsivity as requests are scheduled based on when our resource is available.Most of our clients choose to have at least a small monthly support retainer to get the best responsivity, as dedicated time is scheduled months in advance. If you have a highly technical project with us, then we would recommend opting for a monthly support retainer to cover small ad-hoc changes, improvements, updates and support. We base our retainer pricing on the amount of development and support hours you need each month. The number of hours that you need depends on many factors such as the size of your project, or the number of new features you are likely to need each month that you\u2019d like to be covered by your retainer arrangement. It\u2019s important to us that you get value-for-money so we\u2019d recommend putting together a nice-to-have list so that your allocation is used each month on value-adding improvements. Should you have ongoing project requirements beyond the launch of the first version of your website or app, then you may want to consider taking an AGILE approach to your project and have an ongoing retainer arrangement with us that allows us to build, test and deploy larger new features every month. Under this agreement, we would have a retainer allowance which pays for enough time to develop significant new features. At the start of each month, we would agree on the work that is going to form part of the next sprint (i.e. the next 2-4 weeks) and would deliver the work at the end of that period. Clients who favour AGILE, typically understand that we need to perform significant amounts of work over the coming months, but they might not know when they need what feature, or if the requirements will change. It\u2019s common for start-ups to go AGILE, as the way that users engage with the product once it launches can have a significant impact on which features or changes need to be prioritised, or may give light to new high-priority changes that would be difficult to predict before launch."},{id:"9",title:"Can I make changes to my app or website after its launched?",description:"Yes, in fact, we highly recommend that you begin by launching the simplest possible version of your vision first and continue to adapt it over time. This staged approach is called launching a \u201cminimum viable product\u201d (MVP).The idea behind launching an MVP is that you\u2019ve inevitably made assumptions, and you can\u2019t test these assumptions until you release something to the world. By releasing a lean first version, you can test your assumptions and use this information to decide on the priorities of future requirements. It reduces engineering waste. We have some options around making future changes to your app or website. You can either commission us to update your app or website on a project-by-project basis, whereby we specify, quote, schedule and finally deliver a fixed set of requirements as-and-when you need them. Or, we can take an AGILE approach whereby we schedule in a certain amount of developer time each month to constantly improve things for you. Both approaches have merit, and it\u2019s likely that you will know instinctively reading this as to which is right for you."}]}},{mainImage:"/images/banner/ecommerce.png",image:"/images/icon/ecommerce.png",title:"E-commerce Web  Development",urlTitle:"E-commerce Web  Development",description:"Top-rated E-Commerce website development company to help you boost online store engagement and increase brand exposure.",descriptionSecond:"E-commerce Website Development & Design Services",descriptionThree:"Top-rated E-Commerce website development company to help you boost online store engagement and increase brand exposure.",cate:"Development",new:"E-commerce Web  Development",aboutUs:{title:"Why E-commerce Web  Development matters?",description:"Ut condimentum enim nec diam convallis mollis.

Digital marketing is so versatile, it can be tailored to suit just about any brand!"},{id:"5",title:"What's a digital marketing strategy?",description:"A digital marketing strategy is a plan of attack for your digital efforts. We start our strategies with goals and KPIs, then we decide which tactics will lead us to success."},{id:"6",title:"What are the benefits of digital marketing?",description:"There are so many benefits to digital marketing! The underlying goal of digital marketing is to bring more qualified users to your website. Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."},{id:"7",title:"How do I create a digital marketing strategy to meet my business goals?",description:"This is one of those burning marketing questions. To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel. Keep what works, and replace what doesn\u2019t"},{id:"8",title:"How much should I pay for digital marketing versus traditional?",description:"A Gartner CMO survey found that publicly traded companies spend about 11% of their revenue on marketing, and up to 2/3 of that marketing budget goes to digital. But what about your company?  If you\u2019ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget \u2013 because there\u2019s no \u201cmagic percentage\u201d of revenue to use. If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."},{id:"9",title:"What kind of technologies do you support?",description:"We utilize the latest technology and tools like HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, Angular JS, React JS on the Web front-end as well as Node .JS, PHP, ASP .Net on the back-end of the Web and WordPress."},{id:"10",title:"What are digital marketing platforms?",description:"Digital marketing platforms are other websites or software used to execute digital strategies.

We will also make small changes to your website at no cost."},{id:"13",title:"What social media platforms should I be on?",description:"Don\u2019t fall victim to the myth that your business should be on every social media platform. If your target customer isn\u2019t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don\u2019t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it\u2019s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."},{id:"14",title:"How does content marketing support digital marketing?",description:"Because content marketing is a long-term, long-lasting marketing strategy that requires solid SEO simultaneously, some teams may not see the value in it or know how to measure the value.

For example, when you align your content and SEO strategy with PPC (using our sexy swivel table!), you can unlock major benefits in both organic and paid media channels."},{id:"15",title:"What KPIs should I be tracking, and how?",description:"Your business goals and the source / medium you are choosing to convey your message will determine what KPIs (key performance indicators) measure digital marketing success. For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."},{id:"16",title:"What does \u201cconversion\u201d mean in digital marketing?",description:"Speaking of KPIs, does it seem like everyone defines \u201cconversion\u201d differently? Some companies (or single departments within) may differentiate between a website conversion \u2013 like a contact form completion \u2013 and a sales conversion, which is a successful sale that occurs after a website conversion. In our agency\u2019s experience, companies commonly call sales-oriented website actions conversions, and they call sales, sales. However you want to talk about it, just make sure your internal team and vendors are on the same page."},{id:"17",title:"What does \u201cconversion\u201d mean in digital marketing?",description:"We could just say \u201cpick us\u201d (wink, wink), but that\u2019s not really an answer.

When your audience thinks of your company as a partner interested in their success and a valuable source of advice and guidance, they\u2019re more likely to choose you when it\u2019s time to buy. </p>","<p>That might sound fairly easy, but the truth is that choosing the right types of content in digital writing is far more of an art than a science. What we know has worked for one brand or audience may fall completely flat for another. </p>","<p>Content is, arguably, anything you create that doesn\u2019t contain an overt sales message; it is really that simple. But it is also fairly vague, so we broke it down into the most common categories you are likely to encounter. Those are: </p>","<ul><li>Infographics</li><li>Blog content</li><li>Podcasts</li><li>Videos</li><li>Social media.</li> </ul>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>Blog Content Writing</h5>","<p>Blog posts are most effective when used strictly for good, like most types of content writing. Rather than blogging about how your newest product will change lives, you should be writing about topics related to your products or services.</p>","<p>You literally won\u2019t need to push your products when you establish your company as a leading industry expert, whether locally or internationally. Add genuine impact by adding something new and valuable, above and beyond what the many, many generic blogs out there offer. </p>","<p>After all, your readers want to know what you know and how you can help solve their problem, not what everyone else has already said. Definitely forget leaning hard into keywords, the user experience is far more valuable today. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>Infographic Content Writing</h5>","<p>Of the many different forms of content writing, infographics are one that can really throw a big curveball for digital marketers. It is a shame because a good infographic can get a lot of attention in the form of shares and inbound links.Of course, you can\u2019t use an infographic for everything, nor should you. But choosing the right time and graphic can elevate this content format to the sublime. </p>","<p>Successful infographics are simple, impactful, and meaningful. The point of them is to take a lot of complicated information from a study or survey and break it down into the most important points. </p>","<p>They can be used to punctuate written blogs or as standalone content for both blogging platforms and social media \u2013 just remember to keep it simple and impactful filled with strong data points. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>Podcast Content Writing</h5>","<p>High-quality podcasts have been extremely lucrative for some digital marketers, though they are far from a universal solution for your content needs. Once you have the right equipment, they can be simple to produce and, if distributed through a podcast network, can have massive reach. It is still important to plan a podcast ahead of time, though, and not just try to wing it \u2014 that path only leads to tears.</p>","<p>Use your professionally composed podcast to bring more awareness to your brand from difficult to penetrate markets with specialty niches, and also as a way to showcase your brand\u2019s personality in a very big way. </p>","<p>Even if you are using a podcast network, you can also still incorporate those podcasts into your business\u2019 website and social media efforts as extra content to share with your audience.

Although many prefer written content, those that want video are still wanting to see even more than they can get their hands on right now. </p>","<p>A well-produced video spot shows a whole different side of your business (much like a podcast does) and can give you a better way to create content that demonstrates how to do something or how something works. </p>","<p>Consider videos for more than just blogging; they are also great for teaching someone how to replumb their own sink trap using your product or show potential customers how you manufacture your golf clubs, from start to finish. </p>","<p>Don\u2019t forget to create captions for your videos and include a text introduction to help humans better navigate their way to what they really want to see. You can then use this content almost anywhere, from your main website to your blog, your social media page, or even in email campaigns. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>Social Media Content Writing</h5>","<p>Of the many forms of content writing, social media is one that is often treated alone because it follows a slightly different set of rules. Unlike other digital writing content listed above, social media writing is all about getting people to look AND respond directly. You want engagement that is palpable. </p>","<p>It can take some effort to find both the type of content and medium that really resonates with your social media followers, but if you are already producing other types of content for your writing, the good news is that you can easily repurpose them for social media, too. </p>","<p>By watching your social media analytics, you will be able to figure out pretty quickly if your audience is the type that prefers videos or blogs, serious posts from your CEO, or funny posts from your staff writers. Plus, you will be able to gauge how much traffic social media is generating to your site. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>What are the main content Writing channels?</h5>","<p>Any avenue in which created content is shared to an audience is considered a channel. When building a content writing plan, it\u2019s important to outline which channels will be utilised to distribute your messages. The top 5 channels often include: </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>1. Organic Search</h5>","<p>Organic traffic is gathered without putting up any money to acquire. All content published on your website is indexed by search engines, who then make a determination on how relevant your business and content is for a user making searches. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>2. Paid Search</h5>","<p>Putting money behind a search result to showcase your content front and center, or to place your content within ad-spaces throughout other websites. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>3. Social Sharing Platforms</h5>","<p>Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn \u2013 these are all social platforms that nearly every consumer already digests content. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>4. Emails</h5>","<p>The original in-bound digital writing initiative. Distributing content via email can capture an audience that has already shown interest in your content/products by signing up for emails. </p>","<h5 class='title mb--30'>5.

You\u2019re going to have a tough time generating brand awareness if you lack a strong brand identity through our Branding Services. The following are a few steps that you should take to establish your brand identity:"},{id:"2",title:"Identify your mission",description:"What was the reason you established your company in the first place? What is your company\u2019s goal? Consumers want to know what your mission is (and they don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s \u201cto make a profit\u201d) and it will reflect who you are as a company."},{id:"3",title:"Establish your unique value proposition",description:"Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors. It\u2019s a statement of how your offer benefits your customers, how you will meet the needs of your customers, and what makes your offer unique. Every marketing campaign you run should align with your unique value proposition."},{id:"4",title:"Omnichannel Personalization",description:"The visual elements of your brand certainly factor into your brand identity. Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses. You\u2019ll want to generate awareness of your brand to do this through a variety of marketing efforts, such as building a website that emphasises your mission and unique value proposition, creating content that\u2019s optimised for SEO, using social media to engage with consumers and to post your content, and more. It\u2019s also vital that you make sure your mission, unique value proposition, and visual identity are consistent across all platforms. If it\u2019s not, it will end up hurting your brand identity."},{id:"6",title:"Brand Culture",description:"Brand culture refers to your company\u2019s core values and how you set an example for those values with our Branding Services. Businesses have always emphasised certain values; however, those values were often things like \u201creliability\u201d or \u201chonesty.\u201d Values that are more equivalent to basic ethics. While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example. They have taken strong social positions by running commercials backing Colin Kaepernick and recently touting the importance of the women\u2019s U.S. soccer team\u2019s World Cup win. These are branding efforts touting their championing of equality, which has become a part of their brand culture. The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture:"},{id:"7",title:"Define your values",description:"Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers."},{id:"8",title:"Spread awareness of your values",description:"Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well."},{id:"9",title:"Ensure your company reflects your values",description:"There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company."},{id:"10",title:"Brand Image",description:"Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service. Keeping that in mind, the following are a few ways to build and maintain a positive brand image:"},{id:"11",title:"Spread your message via PR",description:"Use public relations to spread your key messages as well as relevant news concerning your company.

The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture:"},{id:"7",title:"Define your values",description:"Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers."},{id:"8",title:"Spread awareness of your values",description:"Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well."},{id:"9",title:"Ensure your company reflects your values",description:"There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company."},{id:"10",title:"Brand Image",description:"Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service.

It\u2019s an important step in building your brand identity as well. However, it\u2019s particularly important when it comes to developing your brand personality. The way you present yourself and the way that you communicate should reflect not only who the audience is but what they expect. For example, if you have a younger audience, then a dry, formal tone may not resonate with them. However, if your audience is older, using younger slang and current pop culture references may go over their heads."},{id:"16",title:"Engage with your audience",description:"While you can get your personality across in the content you write, it\u2019s easier to do through engaging with people. It\u2019s why using social media is so important. Your entire audience sees your interactions and it helps establish your personality a certain way. For example, Wendy\u2019s has a reputation for having a playful personality because of their use of humor and the pretend feuds that they get into with other brands on Twitter."},{id:"17",title:"Be consistent in tone",description:"If you\u2019re going to be funny and informal on one platform, you need to make sure that personality carries over to all of the other platforms you use, both online and offline.

A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses.

Every marketing campaign you run should align with your unique value proposition."},{id:"4",title:"Omnichannel Personalization",description:"The visual elements of your brand certainly factor into your brand identity. Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses. You\u2019ll want to generate awareness of your brand to do this through a variety of marketing efforts, such as building a website that emphasises your mission and unique value proposition, creating content that\u2019s optimised for SEO, using social media to engage with consumers and to post your content, and more. It\u2019s also vital that you make sure your mission, unique value proposition, and visual identity are consistent across all platforms. If it\u2019s not, it will end up hurting your brand identity."},{id:"6",title:"Brand Culture",description:"Brand culture refers to your company\u2019s core values and how you set an example for those values with our Branding Services. Businesses have always emphasised certain values; however, those values were often things like \u201creliability\u201d or \u201chonesty.\u201d Values that are more equivalent to basic ethics. While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example. They have taken strong social positions by running commercials backing Colin Kaepernick and recently touting the importance of the women\u2019s U.S. soccer team\u2019s World Cup win. These are branding efforts touting their championing of equality, which has become a part of their brand culture. The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture:"},{id:"7",title:"Define your values",description:"Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers."},{id:"8",title:"Spread awareness of your values",description:"Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well."},{id:"9",title:"Ensure your company reflects your values",description:"There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company."},{id:"10",title:"Brand Image",description:"Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service. Keeping that in mind, the following are a few ways to build and maintain a positive brand image:"},{id:"11",title:"Spread your message via PR",description:"Use public relations to spread your key messages as well as relevant news concerning your company. You can do this through news outlets, trade publications, and even online blogs. Public relations will help you raise awareness of your brand and what you\u2019re doing, thereby helping to improve your brand image."},{id:"12",title:"Establish a social presence",description:"Social media is an incredibly effective way to build your brand image, whether it\u2019s by sharing content with consumers, keeping consumers up to date on the latest news and product launches, spreading awareness of your message, and engaging with consumers on a personal level. In fact, you can even use social media to address negative comments. It\u2019s a good way to repair potential damage done to your brand image as a result of a poor customer experience by showing that you care and trying to correct the situation."},{id:"13",title:"Create high-quality content",description:"Content will help to increase brand awareness by bringing in more web traffic. However, it can also help to build your brand authority. By publishing content that is relevant to your company and to your audience (and that\u2019s of high quality), you\u2019ll become a trustworthy source of information, which \u2014 in turn \u2014 will help improve your reputation and increase brand trust."},{id:"14",title:"Brand Personality",description:"Your brand personality refers to the human characteristics that your company has. Developing a brand personality is vital to connecting with your audience on an emotional level and for making your brand relatable. Because of this, make sure that you use the following tips to develop your brand personality:"},{id:"15",title:"Learn who your audience is",description:"Understanding your audience is something that you need to do from the very beginning. It\u2019s an important step in building your brand identity as well. However, it\u2019s particularly important when it comes to developing your brand personality. The way you present yourself and the way that you communicate should reflect not only who the audience is but what they expect. For example, if you have a younger audience, then a dry, formal tone may not resonate with them. However, if your audience is older, using younger slang and current pop culture references may go over their heads."},{id:"16",title:"Engage with your audience",description:"While you can get your personality across in the content you write, it\u2019s easier to do through engaging with people. It\u2019s why using social media is so important. Your entire audience sees your interactions and it helps establish your personality a certain way. For example, Wendy\u2019s has a reputation for having a playful personality because of their use of humor and the pretend feuds that they get into with other brands on Twitter."},{id:"17",title:"Be consistent in tone",description:"If you\u2019re going to be funny and informal on one platform, you need to make sure that personality carries over to all of the other platforms you use, both online and offline. If you\u2019re inconsistent, it will hurt your ability to develop a cohesive brand personality, which will only confuse your audience."}]},faq:{title:"Logo Designing FAQ\u2019s",faqData:[{id:"1",title:"What is the cost of package design?",description:"It depends.

It\u2019s important that you know what your brand identity is and what you want it to be. If you don\u2019t, how is anyone else supposed to know? You\u2019re going to have a tough time generating brand awareness if you lack a strong brand identity through our Branding Services. The following are a few steps that you should take to establish your brand identity:"},{id:"2",title:"Identify your mission",description:"What was the reason you established your company in the first place? What is your company\u2019s goal? Consumers want to know what your mission is (and they don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s \u201cto make a profit\u201d) and it will reflect who you are as a company."},{id:"3",title:"Establish your unique value proposition",description:"Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors. It\u2019s a statement of how your offer benefits your customers, how you will meet the needs of your customers, and what makes your offer unique. Every marketing campaign you run should align with your unique value proposition."},{id:"4",title:"Omnichannel Personalization",description:"The visual elements of your brand certainly factor into your brand identity. Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses. You\u2019ll want to generate awareness of your brand to do this through a variety of marketing efforts, such as building a website that emphasises your mission and unique value proposition, creating content that\u2019s optimised for SEO, using social media to engage with consumers and to post your content, and more. It\u2019s also vital that you make sure your mission, unique value proposition, and visual identity are consistent across all platforms. If it\u2019s not, it will end up hurting your brand identity."},{id:"6",title:"Brand Culture",description:"Brand culture refers to your company\u2019s core values and how you set an example for those values with our Branding Services. Businesses have always emphasised certain values; however, those values were often things like \u201creliability\u201d or \u201chonesty.\u201d Values that are more equivalent to basic ethics. While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example. They have taken strong social positions by running commercials backing Colin Kaepernick and recently touting the importance of the women\u2019s U.S. soccer team\u2019s World Cup win. These are branding efforts touting their championing of equality, which has become a part of their brand culture. The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture:"},{id:"7",title:"Define your values",description:"Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers."},{id:"8",title:"Spread awareness of your values",description:"Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well."},{id:"9",title:"Ensure your company reflects your values",description:"There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company."},{id:"10",title:"Brand Image",description:"Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service. Keeping that in mind, the following are a few ways to build and maintain a positive brand image:"},{id:"11",title:"Spread your message via PR",description:"Use public relations to spread your key messages as well as relevant news concerning your company. You can do this through news outlets, trade publications, and even online blogs. Public relations will help you raise awareness of your brand and what you\u2019re doing, thereby helping to improve your brand image."},{id:"12",title:"Establish a social presence",description:"Social media is an incredibly effective way to build your brand image, whether it\u2019s by sharing content with consumers, keeping consumers up to date on the latest news and product launches, spreading awareness of your message, and engaging with consumers on a personal level. In fact, you can even use social media to address negative comments. It\u2019s a good way to repair potential damage done to your brand image as a result of a poor customer experience by showing that you care and trying to correct the situation."},{id:"13",title:"Create high-quality content",description:"Content will help to increase brand awareness by bringing in more web traffic. However, it can also help to build your brand authority. By publishing content that is relevant to your company and to your audience (and that\u2019s of high quality), you\u2019ll become a trustworthy source of information, which \u2014 in turn \u2014 will help improve your reputation and increase brand trust."},{id:"14",title:"Brand Personality",description:"Your brand personality refers to the human characteristics that your company has. Developing a brand personality is vital to connecting with your audience on an emotional level and for making your brand relatable. Because of this, make sure that you use the following tips to develop your brand personality:"},{id:"15",title:"Learn who your audience is",description:"Understanding your audience is something that you need to do from the very beginning. It\u2019s an important step in building your brand identity as well. However, it\u2019s particularly important when it comes to developing your brand personality. The way you present yourself and the way that you communicate should reflect not only who the audience is but what they expect. For example, if you have a younger audience, then a dry, formal tone may not resonate with them. However, if your audience is older, using younger slang and current pop culture references may go over their heads."},{id:"16",title:"Engage with your audience",description:"While you can get your personality across in the content you write, it\u2019s easier to do through engaging with people. It\u2019s why using social media is so important. Your entire audience sees your interactions and it helps establish your personality a certain way. For example, Wendy\u2019s has a reputation for having a playful personality because of their use of humor and the pretend feuds that they get into with other brands on Twitter."},{id:"17",title:"Be consistent in tone",description:"If you\u2019re going to be funny and informal on one platform, you need to make sure that personality carries over to all of the other platforms you use, both online and offline.

It\u2019s important that you know what your brand identity is and what you want it to be. If you don\u2019t, how is anyone else supposed to know? You\u2019re going to have a tough time generating brand awareness if you lack a strong brand identity through our Branding Services. The following are a few steps that you should take to establish your brand identity:"},{id:"2",title:"Identify your mission",description:"What was the reason you established your company in the first place? What is your company\u2019s goal? Consumers want to know what your mission is (and they don\u2019t want to hear that it\u2019s \u201cto make a profit\u201d) and it will reflect who you are as a company."},{id:"3",title:"Establish your unique value proposition",description:"Your unique value proposition is what sets you apart from your competitors. It\u2019s a statement of how your offer benefits your customers, how you will meet the needs of your customers, and what makes your offer unique. Every marketing campaign you run should align with your unique value proposition."},{id:"4",title:"Omnichannel Personalization",description:"The visual elements of your brand certainly factor into your brand identity. Just consider the logos and colour palettes of some of the biggest companies out there, from Facebook\u2019s simple logo and use of blue to McDonald\u2019s golden arch and yellow and red palette. A strong logo that\u2019s instantly recognisable is important, but so is choosing your colours. Different colours have different meanings and the colours you choose can have a psychological impact on your audience as well. For example, many fast-food restaurants use red and yellow because that combination of colours is thought to stimulate the appetite. Just keep in mind that consistency is key. If you decide to use shades of blue in your logo and on your website, then you should use those same colors for your social media pages, email newsletters, and physical location as well."},{id:"5",title:"Increase brand recognition",description:"It\u2019s going to take some time to get your vision of your brand identity out to the masses. You\u2019ll want to generate awareness of your brand to do this through a variety of marketing efforts, such as building a website that emphasises your mission and unique value proposition, creating content that\u2019s optimised for SEO, using social media to engage with consumers and to post your content, and more. It\u2019s also vital that you make sure your mission, unique value proposition, and visual identity are consistent across all platforms. If it\u2019s not, it will end up hurting your brand identity."},{id:"6",title:"Brand Culture",description:"Brand culture refers to your company\u2019s core values and how you set an example for those values with our Branding Services. Businesses have always emphasised certain values; however, those values were often things like \u201creliability\u201d or \u201chonesty.\u201d Values that are more equivalent to basic ethics. While those are important values to hold onto, more and more businesses have begun taking moral stances as well as political stances in addition to generally accepted values. These types of values feed into your brand culture as well. Take Nike for example. They have taken strong social positions by running commercials backing Colin Kaepernick and recently touting the importance of the women\u2019s U.S. soccer team\u2019s World Cup win. These are branding efforts touting their championing of equality, which has become a part of their brand culture. The following are a few tips to help you establish your brand culture:"},{id:"7",title:"Define your values",description:"Define exactly what your values are and how your company lives out those values. Don\u2019t be afraid of taking a stance if there\u2019s a particular stance that you want to take. Using the Nike example again, their backing of Kaepernick was considered controversial and plenty of consumers did not agree with their position. However, those that did agree with their position became even more strongly aligned with Nike\u2019s brand. You can\u2019t please everyone, but by sticking to your values, you\u2019ll be more likely to strengthen your relationship with many of your customers."},{id:"8",title:"Spread awareness of your values",description:"Let consumers know about your values by declaring them on your website or by encouraging discussion about your values on social media. Publishing content that backs your values is an effective method as well."},{id:"9",title:"Ensure your company reflects your values",description:"There\u2019s nothing consumers hate more than a hypocrite. If you\u2019re flaunting your support for equal pay across social media and in your marketing efforts, then you better be practicing what you preach. Your brand culture is incredibly dependent on your ability to embrace your own values within your company."},{id:"10",title:"Brand Image",description:"Your brand image is similar to your brand identity in that it deals with how your brand is perceived. However, whereas your brand identity is how you want your brand to be perceived, brand image is how your brand is actually perceived. Consider your brand image as the reputation you currently have with the general public. Take for example United Airlines. Not long ago, they updated their brand design in an attempt to strengthen their brand identity as a \u201cthoughtful, modern, and innovative airline.\u201d However, their brand identity and brand image are currently quite different from each other after numerous massive PR failures regarding their customer service. Keeping that in mind, the following are a few ways to build and maintain a positive brand image:"},{id:"11",title:"Spread your message via PR",description:"Use public relations to spread your key messages as well as relevant news concerning your company. You can do this through news outlets, trade publications, and even online blogs. Public relations will help you raise awareness of your brand and what you\u2019re doing, thereby helping to improve your brand image."},{id:"12",title:"Establish a social presence",description:"Social media is an incredibly effective way to build your brand image, whether it\u2019s by sharing content with consumers, keeping consumers up to date on the latest news and product launches, spreading awareness of your message, and engaging with consumers on a personal level. In fact, you can even use social media to address negative comments. It\u2019s a good way to repair potential damage done to your brand image as a result of a poor customer experience by showing that you care and trying to correct the situation."},{id:"13",title:"Create high-quality content",description:"Content will help to increase brand awareness by bringing in more web traffic. However, it can also help to build your brand authority. By publishing content that is relevant to your company and to your audience (and that\u2019s of high quality), you\u2019ll become a trustworthy source of information, which \u2014 in turn \u2014 will help improve your reputation and increase brand trust."},{id:"14",title:"Brand Personality",description:"Your brand personality refers to the human characteristics that your company has. Developing a brand personality is vital to connecting with your audience on an emotional level and for making your brand relatable. Because of this, make sure that you use the following tips to develop your brand personality:"},{id:"15",title:"Learn who your audience is",description:"Understanding your audience is something that you need to do from the very beginning. It\u2019s an important step in building your brand identity as well. However, it\u2019s particularly important when it comes to developing your brand personality. The way you present yourself and the way that you communicate should reflect not only who the audience is but what they expect. For example, if you have a younger audience, then a dry, formal tone may not resonate with them. However, if your audience is older, using younger slang and current pop culture references may go over their heads."},{id:"16",title:"Engage with your audience",description:"While you can get your personality across in the content you write, it\u2019s easier to do through engaging with people. It\u2019s why using social media is so important. Your entire audience sees your interactions and it helps establish your personality a certain way. For example, Wendy\u2019s has a reputation for having a playful personality because of their use of humor and the pretend feuds that they get into with other brands on Twitter."},{id:"17",title:"Be consistent in tone",description:"If you\u2019re going to be funny and informal on one platform, you need to make sure that personality carries over to all of the other platforms you use, both online and offline. If you\u2019re inconsistent, it will hurt your ability to develop a cohesive brand personality, which will only confuse your audience."}]},faq:{title:"Logo Designing FAQ\u2019s",faqData:[{id:"1",title:"What is the cost of package design?",description:"It depends.

With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone.

If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed.

Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best.

The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns.

If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed.

Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best.

The underlying goal of digital marketing is to bring more qualified users to your website. Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."},{id:"7",title:"How do I create a digital marketing strategy to meet my business goals?",description:"This is one of those burning marketing questions.

Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget \u2013 because there\u2019s no \u201cmagic percentage\u201d of revenue to use. If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed.

If your target customer isn\u2019t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best.

We start our strategies with goals and KPIs, then we decide which tactics will lead us to success."},{id:"6",title:"What are the benefits of digital marketing?",description:"There are so many benefits to digital marketing! The underlying goal of digital marketing is to bring more qualified users to your website. Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."},{id:"7",title:"How do I create a digital marketing strategy to meet my business goals?",description:"This is one of those burning marketing questions. To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel.

But what about your company? If you\u2019ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget \u2013 because there\u2019s no \u201cmagic percentage\u201d of revenue to use. If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed.

If your target customer isn\u2019t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don\u2019t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it\u2019s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."},{id:"14",title:"How does content marketing support digital marketing?",description:"Because content marketing is a long-term, long-lasting marketing strategy that requires solid SEO simultaneously, some teams may not see the value in it or know how to measure the value.

We start our strategies with goals and KPIs, then we decide which tactics will lead us to success."},{id:"6",title:"What are the benefits of digital marketing?",description:"There are so many benefits to digital marketing! The underlying goal of digital marketing is to bring more qualified users to your website. Through a mix of digital marketing tactics, you are able to guide users through their online journey, resulting in more conversions for your business. The beauty of digital marketing is that all of the tactics work together in harmony. An effective digital marketing strategy will also reinforce your traditional marketing, providing your target audience with cohesive messaging. There are also a number of benefits to digital marketing over traditional marketing. Digital marketing is flexible. With digital, you have the ability to make changes over the course of a campaign, unlike traditional where you\u2019re locked into long campaigns that are set in stone. Digital campaigns are also much easier to track because you can set up tracking pixels, create robust event tracking across your website and develop trackable links using utm parameters, which all tie your success directly back to specific campaigns. These pixels allow for remarketing campaigns which target users who have previously visited your website based on the actions they took."},{id:"7",title:"How do I create a digital marketing strategy to meet my business goals?",description:"This is one of those burning marketing questions. To refine or create a digital marketing strategy, start by clearly writing down what your business goals are and agreeing on them internally. We love the SMART goal format: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Timely. If you need some structure, check out our SMART goals template. Next, go through existing and past digital marketing efforts, and look at the data to see how strategies performed in each channel.

But what about your company? If you\u2019ve been doing digital marketing for a while, you may know your usual return on ad spend (ROAS), potential customer lifetime value and other ROI information. Use these to assess cost versus benefit and build your budget \u2013 because there\u2019s no \u201cmagic percentage\u201d of revenue to use. If you don\u2019t have that historic data to work with, set a maximum budget you are comfortable with, and watch performance closely to adjust as needed. When deciding how to allocate budget for digital marketing versus traditional, think about your audience. Where are they consuming media the most? What ad mediums have performed well in the past? Try some new things out, test and revise."},{id:"9",title:"What kind of technologies do you support?",description:"We utilize the latest technology and tools like HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3, Angular JS, React JS on the Web front-end as well as Node .JS, PHP, ASP .Net on the back-end of the Web and WordPress."},{id:"10",title:"What are digital marketing platforms?",description:"Digital marketing platforms are other websites or software used to execute digital strategies.

If your target customer isn\u2019t on a particular social media platform, then you may not need to be either. Each social media platform releases its demographic information, making it easier to see which platforms your audience likes best. Also, if you don\u2019t have internal resources to manage a lot of social media activity, it\u2019s better to use two platforms well than it is to use four badly. Or you can find a partner to handle your social media marketing."},{id:"14",title:"How does content marketing support digital marketing?",description:"Because content marketing is a long-term, long-lasting marketing strategy that requires solid SEO simultaneously, some teams may not see the value in it or know how to measure the value. That\u2019s why this is one of the most asked marketing questions. But the truth is, great content marketing supports all your other digital marketing strategies. For example, when you align your content and SEO strategy with PPC (using our sexy swivel table!), you can unlock major benefits in both organic and paid media channels."},{id:"15",title:"What KPIs should I be tracking, and how?",description:"Your business goals and the source / medium you are choosing to convey your message will determine what KPIs (key performance indicators) measure digital marketing success. For example, if your goal is to increase the number of visitors that convert to leads on your blog, then you would want to track blog sessions and resulting lead forms and/or clicks-to-call. The KPI you care about may vary based on your role in the company and who you report to."},{id:"16",title:"What does \u201cconversion\u201d mean in digital marketing?",description:"differently?
