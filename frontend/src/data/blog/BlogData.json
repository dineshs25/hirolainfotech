            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>1. Target Relevant Primary and Secondary Keywords</h4>",
            "<p>Keyword research is the foundation of any good SEO strategy. If you know how to use keywords effectively, you can develop content that attracts more people to your website. The first step is to identify your page’s primary and secondary keywords.</p>", 
            "<p>Your primary keyword is the main focus of your content. You only need to pick one primary keyword per page. It should be relevant to what your page’s focus, your brand identity, your products, and your services. </p>", 
            "<p> Your secondary keywords support the main topic. You will probably have several of these. Often, they’re more granular than the primary keyword and represent subtopics you’re covering throughout an article. Try to include them naturally in your content, but don’t force them if they don’t fit. </p>",
            "<p>You can use the Keyword Magic Tool to find your primary and secondary keywords.</p>",
            "<p>First, enter a seed keyword representing the main topic you want to target. </p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-1-img.png'/>",
            "<p>Next, choose your primary keyword. Try and find one that’s super relevant and aligns with your goals. For example, perhaps you want to write an educational blog post about travel, and you want to find a keyword with a lower difficulty.</p>",
            "<p>Pay close attention to the Questions and Related Keywords sections to build your list of potential supporting keywords.             </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>2. Write Quality Original Content</h4>",

            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-2-img.png'/>",
            "<img src='/images/team/team-2.png'/>",
            "<p>If you want users to find and return to your site, you need quality content that is original, comprehensive, and evergreen.</p>",
            "<p>Original content shows the audience your unique perspective and expertise and enables them to build a relationship with you. What’s more, search engine algorithms, especially Google, are designed to sniff out unique content. Those who practise good SEO and publish trustworthy original content are likely to increase searches. </p>",
            "<p>Ideally, your content should be comprehensive. That means the content you publish answers everything a user might want to know about that topic. Comprehensive pages help show search engines that you’re an authority on that topic. </p>",
            "<p>The SEO Content Template Tool can help you write more comprehensive content. It analyses high-ranking competitor content for your target keyword and tells you what attributes you should target to perform well. </p>",
            "<p>Finally, evergreen content has long-term value, which will continue to be relevant and generate traffic over a long period. Inbound marketing is the gift that keeps on giving because it continues to produce results while your focus is elsewhere. </p>",
            "<p>When creating evergreen content, think about what topics will bring long-term value to your readers without needing significant updates. Try to avoid seasonal, breaking news stories, or time-sensitive data stories. These pages are unlikely to remain relevant over time.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Format Your Content for Search Engines & Target Featured Snippets</h4>",
            "<p>If you want the content you write to perform well, make sure you’re answering the questions your audience is asking. One way to do this is to target featured snippets.</p>",
            "<p>Featured snippets appear at the top of the search results page on Google. They’re designed to answer a user’s question without requiring them to leave the page. They’re highly visible, helpful, and likely to attract organic traffic since they appear before numbered results. You might also see them referred to as SERP features.</p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-3-img.png'/>",
            "<p>These positions are highly sought after by digital marketers. To win one, you need to optimize your content to target them. The strategies you use to target featured snippets can make your content more helpful to readers and improve your SEO, even if you don’t win the snippet in question.</p>",
            "<p>First, choose which content you want to optimize to <a href='https://hirolainfotech.com/search-engine-optimisation/'> SEO services</a> ,target a featured snippet. Use the Keyword Magic tool to identify relevant keywords with the search intent and SERP feature you want to target. </p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-4-img.png'/>",
            "<p>Next, search for that keyword yourself to see what type of content is currently featured. Make a note of what question the content answers and how it’s written. You can also see top SERP results in your target location by selecting the triangle next to a keyword in the tool.</p>",
            "<p>For example, is the snippet a bulleted list or a table? Is the information correct? What else ranks well? These observations will give you an idea of how to edit your content.</p>",
            "<p>Now edit your content. </p>",
            "<p>Make sure your content both asks and answers the target question in the snippet as clearly and concisely as possible. After all, studies show that a piece of content that asks a question is more likely to have a featured snippet. </p>",
            "<p>Organize your page using heading and subheaders. If it makes sense for your page, try to use one of your subheaders to target your desired SERP feature. Headings and subheadings make it easy to understand or search your page, which can help improve your search ranking.</p>",
            "<p>Finally, tighten up your page’s copy. Try to use short, direct sentences (no more than 20 words) with language that isn’t too complicated. And while you should try to avoid single-sentence paragraphs, you don’t want them to be too long, either.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Optimize Your Page Title and Meta Description</h4>",
            "<p>Your page title and meta description might be the first thing your audience ever sees. Users might decide whether to click or skip your page based on these alone. That’s a lot of power for so few words, so make sure they’re impactful.</p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-5-img.png'/>",
            "<p>Typically, whatever platform you use to host your website offers an easy way to edit your page title and meta description. WordPress, for instance, offers two boxes labelled “SEO title” and “meta description.”</p>",
            "<p>Here are a few tips to remember: </p>",
            "<ul><li>Keep your page title between 30 and 60 characters</li><li>Keep your meta description under 160 characters</li><li>Include your target keyword</li><li>Communicate what your page is about and what makes it unique</li><li>Make sure your title and meta description are unique for every page</li></ul>",
            "<p>Not sure where to start? Use the Topic Research tool to look at other successful headlines related to your topic to generate ideas. The SEO Content Template can also suggest some keywords you might want to include. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>5. Use Short, Descriptive URLs</h4>",
            "<p>Improving your URL structure can significantly impact your on-page SEO with relatively little effort. A clean URL can help search engines understand your page and gives you a more user-friendly appearance in the SERPs.</p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-6-img.png'/>",
            "<p>Best of all, it’s relatively easy to do, even for SEO beginners. </p>",
            "<p>An effective URL should:</p>",
            "<ul><li>Use keywords: Try to include your primary keyword, if you can</li><li>Be readable: When your visitor reads the URL, it should be easy for them to understand what the page is about</li><li>Be concise: Shorter URLs (around 60 characters) are preferable. That’s because many search engines can’t process longer URLs and might rank you lower as a result.</li></ul>",
            "<p>Of course, that’s not the only way to generate backlinks. Here are a few other ideas:</p>",
            "<ul><li>Offer to write a guest post for other outlets, particularly if you have an interesting infographic or something else to offer. </li><li>Reach out to publishers to cover any original research or data you’ve put together for your on-site content. </li><li>Get listed in industry directories. You may need to join professional industry associations, networking groups, or business organizations, so you can further establish credibility.</li></ul>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>6. Generate Backlinks from High Site Authority Websites</h4>",
            "<p>Backlinks, or external links leading to your site, are a critical ranking factor. Links from reputable sources can increase your site’s authority and improve your SEO over time. You can acquire those backlinks through a process called link building.</p>",
            "<p>But how do you know which backlink sources to target? It’s simple: find out who your competitors get their backlinks from. Use the Backlink Gap Tool to compare your current backlink profile with your competitors and find new opportunities.</p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-img-7.png'/>",
            "<ul><li>Enter your domain and up to four competitors, and click “Find prospects.”</li><li>Use the report filters to narrow down your results. For example, you might choose to look only at the best opportunities with an Authority Score of 80 or higher.</li><li>Select the backlink opportunities you’re interested in pursuing, and click “Start outreach” to send them to a Link Building tool project. Use the Link Building tool to pursue them without ever leaving Semrush. If you don’t have a current Link Building tool project, you’ll be prompted to create one.</li></ul>",
            "<p>To use the Backlink Gap tool: </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>7. Remove Anything That Loads Slowly</h4>",
            "<p>Page load time doesn’t just impact user experience. It can also affect your SEO. After all, if a page loads too slowly, users are unlikely to stick around, increasing your bounce rate. A page’s loading time is one of the three Core Web Vitals and a ranking factor.</p>",
            "<p><a href='https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/'>Google PageSpeed Insights</a> is a free SEO tool that scores your desktop and mobile page speed on a scale of zero to 100, with 100 being the fastest. </p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-img-8.png'/>",
            "<p>If your page loads too slowly, look for page elements that might be increasing your load time. For example, do you have unnecessary plugins added to your page? Try removing them to increase your page’s speed.            </p>",
            "<p>You can check your site for this and other factors using <a href='https://www.semrush.com/features/site-audit/'>the Site Audit tool.</a> Site Audit has over 140 checks for various SEO issues, including slow loading time, HTTPS implementation, markups, Core Web Vitals, broken links, and more. Use it in tandem with PageSpeed insights to ensure your site is up to speed. </p>",
            "<p>Read more about Core Web Vitals and how to improve your page speed in our blog post. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>8. Use a Mix of Internal and External Links</h4>",
            "<img src=${https://hirolainfotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/12-Essential-SEO-Tips-for-Beginners-to-Boost-Traffic-2.png} alt='blog-images'/>",
            "<p>Using internal and external links effectively can improve crawlability, user experience, and credibility. Ideally, these links should lead to useful, relevant information.</p>",
            "<p>Internal links direct users to other pages on your site. They help search engine crawlers find your content and encourage users to stay on your site longer. For example, you could link between related blog posts to help your audience find more information on a topic they’re researching without ever leaving your site. </p>",
            "<p>External links are links that lead a user to another website. You can use these to link to websites with quality, authoritative content on the topic you’re writing about. Remember to vet your external links before adding them, as linking to low-quality content could negatively impact your credibility.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>9. Optimize Your Graphics </h4>",
            "<p>It’s hard to resist a colorful graphic or an image that perfectly captures the essence of a topic. If you create such images for your website, make sure they’re optimized. Here are a few things to keep in mind: </p>",
            "<ul><li>Size and Formatting: Make sure you’re using the image size and file type that works best for your readers. If an image is too large, it could slow down your page. If the file type isn’t supported, the image might not load at all.</li><li>Accessibility: Always include descriptive alt text for each image. Not only does this help make your site more accessible for screen readers, but it also creates opportunities to integrate more supporting keywords. Avoid embedding important text elements in your images unless there’s another way to access them.</li><li>Context: Provide context for your images by placing them beside relevant text on your page. If possible, try to place your most important image near the top of the page.</li><li>Links: Create descriptive names and logical URL structures for all of your images. Not only does this help to optimize them for organic search, but it also makes it easier for others to share your pictures on their sites, potentially granting you backlinks.</li><li>Test: Always remember to test your pages on mobile and desktop. Users tend to search in Google Images from mobile more often than on desktop, so optimizing your images for mobile could have additional benefits.</li></ul>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>10. Conduct Regular Site Audits</h4>",
            "<p>Performing regular site audits helps to ensure your site remains both functional and user-friendly. It’s also an excellent way to catch issues you might have missed, like broken links, orphaned pages, or slow load times. Then, you can prioritize and address them before they have a significant impact.</p>",
            "<p>To get started: </p>",
            "<ul><li>Create a new project for your website.</li><li>Specify your page source and how many pages you’d like to crawl.</li><li>Provide any additional specifications, including your crawler settings, disallowed URLs, or URL parameters.</li><li>Run or schedule your site audit.</li></ul>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>11. Study Your Competitors</h4>",
            "<p>Chances are, you and your biggest rivals are creating similar types of content and targeting a similar audience. By analyzing your competitors’ websites, you can learn more about effective content mediums or generate new ideas for your content.</p>",
            "<p>First, identify your most important rivals. The Market Explorer tool can help you track major players in your niche and how much traffic they generate. </p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-img-9.png'/>",
            "<p>The Traffic Analytics tool can show you how much traffic your competitors earn, as well as their major traffic sources and traffic channels (paid, social, etc.)</p>",
            "<p>Use the Organic Research tool to get an overview of their organic search performance, including their top-performing pages. </p>",
            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-img-10.png'/>",
            "<p>Finally, use the Keyword Gap tool to identify keywords your competitors rank for that you’re missing out on. </p>",

            "<img src='/images/blog/blog-img-11.png'/>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>12. Continue Learning About SEO</h4>",
            "<p>One thing every digital marketer knows: Google’s algorithm is constantly changing, and as it does, the digital landscape continues to evolve. That’s why educating yourself about SEO is crucial if you want to stay ahead and keep winning.</p>",
            "<h4>Final Thoughts </h4>",
            "<p>If you want your site to succeed, you need SEO, period. Even for the experts, mastering SEO is a process of constant learning, experimentation, and creativity. Use these tips to produce the results you want and conquer the SERPs, no matter your experience level. </p>"

            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Data Collection</h4>",
            "<p>Businesses are expected to take more initiative in gathering data as they move into 2023. You can use forms to gather information about customers. This could help you improve your sales funnel and even influence your next business move. Even the simplest forms can provide valuable information that will help you convert browsers into customers.</p>" ,
            "<p>You can enter customer data using a CRM such as HubSpot. This will allow you to add customers to your mailing list, or monitor their activity on your website. This will allow your sales team to better understand where they are in the buyer journey of each website visitor.</p>" ,
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Google Verified Listings For Local SEO</h4>",
            "<p>Your Google My Business listing is valuable for local businesses, such as a plumber or a veterinarian clinic. It also helps to establish your geographic location.</p>" ,
            "<p>Having a geographically-defined service area with Google My Business listing aids in showing up for “near me” searches. Customers can also find out more about your business in Google Search results. A potential customer can view your address, open hours, star rating, and star rating as well as your current status.</p>" ,
            "<p>Verify your Google Business Listing to ensure that the information is accurate. Keep it updated. Verifying your business is beneficial:</p>" ,
            "<p>Search, Maps, or other Google properties can be used to manage your business information.</p>" ,
            "<p>Verified businesses are more reliable and trustworthy than unverified competitors.</p>" ,
            "<p>Verifying your business will prevent fraud from occurring in the unlikely event that another person attempts to claim your listing as theirs and pretends to be the owner.</p>" ,
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Voice Search</h4>",
            "<p>Voice-activated digital assistants continue to be huge sellers, and let’s be realistic – some households talk to Alexa, Siri, or Cortana more than they speak to family members. The popularity of voice search both at home and on our phones has led to one of the most significant shifts in using keywords.</p>" ,
            "<p>Think about it. When we type a search into Google, we phrase it differently than when we use Alexa for information. For example, a person looking for the nearest Indian restaurant might type “Indian restaurant Raleigh” into Google, but might ask Cortana, “where is the closest Indian restaurant”. When writing content, choose your keywords based on the questions people may ask when using Siri or Alexa. This can increase your visibility, and this digital marketing trend shows no sign of slowing down.</p>" ,
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Visual Search</h4>",
            "<p>Google now allows users to upload images and receive information about items from the picture. A plant photo will return species information. A landmark image will return historical data. It returns similar products and places to purchase them when a user searches for a particular product. Google Lens, Pinterest Lens and other related search tools transform a user’s smartphone into a search bar.</p>" ,
            "<p>What can you do to make visual search work for your business? If your target market is on Pinterest, you can add high-quality images with descriptive keywords to your online inventory. You also have the option of introducing an image search in your online inventory. They offer a boost in search results for brands that advertise on them.</p>" ,
            "<p>Also, consider these:</p>" ,
            "<p>Having an image sitemap increases the chances of your images being found by search engines</p>" ,
            "<p>Before uploading images to your website, use descriptive file names</p>" ,
            "<p>Add alternative text to all images (aka “Alt tags”)</p>" ,

            "<p>Ads specialists review every bit of data to ensure the best results for a Google Ads campaign. They also tweak and adjust keywords and bids as needed. This meticulous attention to detail can produce great results but it can also be exhausting. The business owner who tries to manage a campaign can become overwhelmed and fail.</p>" ,
            "<p>Automated bidding strategies are available. These strategies allow Google to make use of machine learning to analyze its vast amount of data to adjust your bids immediately. Ad specialists can use automated strategies, while maintaining complete control. Although automated bidding is not new, Smart Bidding was launched in 2016. However, most business owners don’t know what it is and what it does.</p>" ,
            "<p>There are many human strategies involved in optimising PPC performance. It’s not enough to just set it and forget about it. You need to constantly test all aspects of your PPC performance, even automated bid strategies.</p>" ,
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Platforms for Real-Time Messaging</h4>",
            "<p>It is now possible to communicate with customers quickly and efficiently using real-time messaging platforms. You must do all you can to give prospects as much information and as many details as possible in this age of instant gratification. Otherwise, you risk losing them to a rival. As businesses seek to improve customer interaction and engagement, expect to see more platforms like these.</p>" ,
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Google Analytics 4</h4>",
            "<p>Google announced that the Universal Analytics platform, which is well-known to many, will be considered a legacy tool in 2023. Don’t fret! Google Analytics 4, also known as GA4, is a new version of the beloved UA, with a few extra bells and whistles.</p>" ,
            "<p>GA4 gives you the ability to link to Google Merchant Center and Google Optimize natively. Your custom reports can be added to the navigation menu to make it easier to find the same view. Access to predictive analytics, anomaly detection, deeper attribution models and more will also be available.</p>" ,
            "<p>It is important to set up your GA4 account as soon possible. This will give you more time to familiarize yourself with the new marketing tool.

            "<p>Build your reputation as a figure of authority, but don’t push your website as the best place to get all the answers. People will get wise to this quickly and you’ll waste time and effort.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don’t Link to Your Homepage</h4>",
            "<p>You’ll need backlinks to specific pages of your website to show relevance, page authority, and more. If you’re only getting links to your homepage Google might consider it spam and won’t consider these backlinks when ranking you.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don’t Recycle Your Content on Different Pages</h4>",
            "<p>While guest blogging is a good idea for backlinking, if you simply copy your content to other sites, you run the risk of becoming a victim to ‘duplicate content.’ </p>",
            "<p>Duplicate content dilutes the potential of both pieces of content, as Google has to eventually choose between the two when deciding what to rank. </p>",
            "<h2 class='title mb--30'>5 things to Consider when Choosing a Link-Building Service</h2>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>1. Site Reputation & Link Quality</h4>",
            "<p>To determine reputation, you could look to a site’s authority score, which forecasts how well a website will rank on a SERP. Scores are ranked on a scale of 1–100. The higher the score, the higher the likelihood of the page ranking high in Google’s SERP.</p>",
            "<p>Another factor to consider when it comes to backlinks is niche relevance. If websites in a similar niche as yours backlink to you, then your ranking will benefit. Receiving a backlink from a website similar to yours but not as closely related doesn’t have that strong of an impact. </p>",
            "<p>Niche relevance also helps Google understand what your site is about. Backlinks from niched sites can further your authority in that niche and heighten the likelihood your site is returned for a user’s intent.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>2. Automation Process</h4>",
            "<p>As mentioned above, automated emails can feel impersonal and won’t net as many positive returns as a custom email. Of course, you can customise some templates to make the process of emailing more efficient.</p>",
            "<p>The flip side to automation is scheduling and following up on leads and link requests. If you’ve spent the time creating content and then have a service send out link requests, you need to follow up.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>3. Service Cost</h4>",
            "<p>If a service costs more, will it do more for you? Are you paying for a large agency? Does it feel like good value to you?</p>",
            "<p>Feel free to compare different services to see if there are similarities in pricing and features.</p>",
            "<p>What will be the return on investment? Do you want a guaranteed amount of links or quality of links?</p>",
            "<p>Do you get monthly reports as part of your investment? Are you given any visibility into the process as part of your investment? What return will you be happy with?</p>",
            "<p>The better the backlink, the better your potential search result. How this translates to revenue depends on your website and where the link lands. A financial ROI may be difficult to measure.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>4. What Is the Backlink Profile of the Service?</h4>",
            "<p>This metric can be the proof in the pudding. If the backlink service you’re investigating has a good backlink profile and other sites point to them as masters in their craft, then excellent — they know what they’re doing.</p>",
            "<p>However, if the backlink service you’re checking out has a poor backlink profile, you might wonder about their ability to earn backlinks for your website as well.</p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>5. Reviews</h4>",
            "<p>What are other clients saying about this service? When you search for backlink provider reviews, what is the consensus about the service?</p>",
            "<p>Consider the credibility and relevance of those people giving the reviews. Are those reviews on forums or a social media channel randomly linking to a backlink service? Is it a review on a reputable site linking to the 10 best link-building services?</p>",
            "<p>Whose opinion would you trust?</p>"

No, Youtube also has this story feature. Stories are a sort of news feed but in a more visual sort of way rather than the text ones. This story concept was initially started by Snapchat, where you can put short videos or images in your stories that last just for 24 hours. Now every other social media platform has this concept.

            "<p>Collaborating with influencers leads to multiple benefits like increasing your followers, brand awareness and sales.

            "<p>Social media is the influencer’s empire, and the beauty of it is that you don’t have to be a large company with big budgets to use its privileges. Small and medium corporations with limited funds can also use the power of influencer marketing by connecting with micro-influencers who have a follower count of more than 1000. They may have less follower count but check engagement rate. Sometimes these micro-influencers get the best engagement rates.  </p>",

We have made a list of emerging trends in SEO that will come in handy for your business to stay on top of the search engines without any hindrances. They are as follows:",

            "<h2 class='title mb--30'>Emerging Trends in SEO:</h2>",
            "<p class='title mb--30'>1) Core web vitals and Page speed:</p>",
            "<p>Earlier in 2020, Google announced three new metrics, such as core web vitals. It is used for measuring the consumer experience as Largest contentful paint (loading), First input delay (interactivity) and Cumulative layout shift (stability). All of these three SEO metrics are related to one thing that is the Page speed. How does the page load, how stable it is, and how soon it gets interactive. It means that page speed will play a crucial role in ranking your website, and you must pay attention to it. </p>",
            "<p>It was applied to assure a great customer experience, and the customer should not leave the page due to a bad experience. It means that you have to pay heavy consideration to rank on search engines.  </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>2) Customer focus:</h4>",
            "<p>The approach towards a successful SEO strategy is that what is best for your customers is best for SEO. Google wants to give its customers the most satisfying user experience. Whenever the user searches for something, he/she should get the relevant searches. The user must feel satisfied, and if they are satisfied, they will come next time searching for you.  </p>",
            "<p>Put yourself in your user’s shoes and ask yourself if the content that you were looking for in the website is valuable, informational, and trusting, then won’t you be coming back on that website? Of course, you will.  </p>",
            "<p>You must add something useful and relevant for your users so that they keep on coming back to you. It will help you in getting loyal users to your website constantly. It will further help in ranking also. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>3) Mobile SEO:</h4>",
            "<p>The most stunning trend nowadays is mobile SEO. You must make sure that the website you have made is mobile friendly. Most people make most of their exploring by mobile phones. Google will eventually begin to focus on mobile SEO as compared to desktop/computer SEO. Because Google focuses on users’ needs. The majority of people explore search engines using their mobile phones. So your rankings might go abysmal. </p>",
            "<p>If you’re performing SEO for desktops/computers and not for mobile phones, undoubtedly, your desktop/computer ranking may be increasing, but your mobile ranking could be wretched. Concentrating on mobile SEO is also crucial and is simply continuing to enhance. So, it’s high time to start working on mobile SEO as well. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>4) Search intent:</h4>",
            "<p>When you write a new piece of content for your website, you must be concentrating more on the search engine results page (SERP) rather than google search console, semrush or any other tool. The search engine page will show you what your audience is looking for more. Google will tell you your users’ searching intent. It will give you an idea of what content you must create and not create. It will tell you what your customers are hunting for, and you must try to write content that they are steadily looking for. By approaching those needs you get a chance to increase your conversion rate. The purpose of SEO is not just to get higher traffic to your website. It should also specialise in increasing leads and profits for your business.  </p>",

            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>5) Change quickly:</h4>",
            "<p>The field of SEO is changing persistently. Google updates its algorithms time-to-time, and you must keep in touch with those changes to stay in the competition. If you are not able to change with time and adapt to these changes quickly, you fall out of the competition. In the coming years, you must think differently to stay at the top and in competition. You will have to plan for more strategic SEO implementation keeping in mind your audience search intent. You can use tools, google trends to see what customers are looking for and implement your strategies focusing on them. </p>",

            "<p>Voice searching undoubtedly is going to transform the way people interact with search engines. Most people search using voice search features. Sometimes, the problems that customers are looking for are big, and you don’t feel like typing for it. This is where voice search technology is beneficial. You can just ask your query instead of typing it and get instant results. Voice search is evolving with time, and it will continue to grow in the coming years as well. It will play an important role in ranking search engines. </p>",

            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>9) Keyword marketing:</h4>",
            "<p>Keyword marketing is an essential element of SEO. It helps in getting your website ranked faster. Without targeting any keyword, it is tough to rank your website.

            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Calculating ROI</h4>",
            "<p>In plain terms, to calculate ROI, subtract the spend from the return, then divide the return by the amount spent. </p>",
            "<p>ROI = current value of investment minus cost of investment divided by cost of investment. </p>",
            "<p>This will give you a decimal that can be expressed as a percentage (in this case, 100%). You’ll already know this but if it’s a positive number, well done, your activity drove more money than you spent. If it’s negative, it probably wasn’t worth the effort. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>The underlying stats</h4>",
            "<p>The actual formula for ROI is relatively straightforward. Adding up how much you spend should also be simple, providing you have kept accurate records. Add up everything from time spent, salaries paid, agency fees, media spend, design costs and anything else you can think of for the most accurate reflection. </p>",
            "<p>The most difficult part with content marketing is putting a figure on the return. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Lead generation</h4>",
            "<p>Identifying the return is easier for some types of content over others. If your content is behind a lead-generation form that requires users to enter their details before accessing the file, you’re in luck. Evaluating the amount of business it drove is as simple as matching the lead value to the downloads. It may be worth doing this with potential lead value (whether it was won or lost) and actual sales value. This way, you can prove the worth of your content – it’s up to the sales team to close the lead. </p>",
            "<p>You can see this method in action with Hubspot’s Complete Collection of Content Creation Templates. If you want to download them, you have to tell Hubspot who you are, and you can bet they’ll get in contact afterwards. If your lead-generation form is connected to your customer database – like Hubspot’s will be – then this process is even more simple. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Alternative ways of evaluating return</h4>",
            "<p>For other types of content, it’s less straightforward. Blogs, videos, articles, guest posts, infographics, case studies and other pieces of content will all contribute to sales in various ways without getting that final conversion. To find the ROI for these, you’ll have to be more creative as there are many methods: </p>",
            "<ul><li>Engagement For some, the amount of engagement a page drives is a good indicator of its value. A higher number of page views, time on site and a lower bounce rate are all good indicators of engagement. The more engaged your users are, the more likely they are to get in touch or buy from you.</li><li>SEO performance Your content may be extremely valuable at improving your search rankings and driving visits – and, ultimately, sales – for your site. To work out the return of individual pages or pieces of content, you can work out the page views as a percentage of total page views, and extrapolate this to the total amount of business driven by natural search. This can also apply to sections of your site, for example your blog.</li><li>Backlinks Backlinks are important for good SEO performance. If backlinks are one of your goals, they can be used to determine the value of content. The number of backlinks is important, but the quality of the sites linking to you can be even more so.</li><li>Social media metrics Content is the lifeblood of successful social media, so the amount of business coming from social links is often a good indicator of successful content. Keeping track of likes, shares and views of different posts is also a good demonstration of the value of different content.</li></ul>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Attribution models in Google Analytics</h4>",
            "<p>There are many ways of attributing the value of sales you have made to the marketing efforts that drove them. It’s a complex journey, because users move between channels over a significant period of time before they make their purchase. </p>",
            "<p>Google Analytics is a great free tool that is helpful when evaluating the return of content. Its Page Value metric puts a financial figure against each page based on the contribution it makes to sales. The higher the number, the higher the value. </p>",

            "<p>The tool also allows you to look at your content marketing performance using different attribution models, providing you have <a href='https://hirolainfotech.com/e-commerce-web-development/'>e-commerce</a> tracking set up. There are the standard models: first click, last click, time decay and linear. There is also the option to create a custom model. It’s worth looking at your content using different models to see how and where it contributes, so you can optimise it. </p>",

            "<p>Right now, it appears as if there are too many copywriting jobs than there are writers available to do them. This brings two questions to mind: is it possible to strike a balance, and how? </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Demand for the Best Writing Talent</h4>",
            "<p>It’s easy to understand why there is a huge demand for writing talent. Virtually all types of B2B marketing requires B2B content at one point or the other. Anytime your content is compared to that of a competitor, having a writer on your team who can capture the attention of your readers gives you a great advantage. </p>",
            "<p>Obviously, there are upsides to having in-house copywriters, especially for companies with heavy workloads. Firstly, being able to call on the talents at your disposal without having to wait until a freelancer is free, can be very beneficial. Secondly, there are positive cost implications because in-house B2B content writers earn less than the average copywriter. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Why is there a shortage of writers?</h4>",
            "<p>The top brands and B2B agencies have a plethora of content jobs available, but let’s take a look at why the best writers aren’t always queuing up to take them. </p>",
            "<ul><li>thB2B copywriting can be difficult B2B writing is not easy. If you’re looking for a writer who wants to write about B2B topics such as IP law and insurance software, you’ll need to find someone with a good grasp of the subject, understand how it ties in with the business side of things, and be a good-enough writer to create compelling copy. This is a tough ask for a lot of people.ree</li><li>They don’t need the work These days, good freelancers are well paid. So, it isn’t surprising to find that a freelancer you’re offering a job to already earns more than you’re willing to pay. And to top it off, as a freelancer they get to work in the comfort of their home, whenever they want. So, why would they want to leave all that comfort just to take a B2B copywriting job in an office? The incentives are not always enough.</li></ul>",
            "<p>How can you fix this problem? By hiring your own B2B copywriters and training them to your company’s high standards.  </p>",
            "<p>A B2B copywriter that knows their subject matter will not just come out of nowhere, ready-made to work for you. Once you’re able to recognise this, you’ll know you have just a few options. You can continue hiring freelancers, engage the services of a <A href='https://hirolainfotech.com/content-marketing/'> B2B copywriting agency</a>, employ trainee writers and train them, and improve the skills of your current marketing team through training. All these options come with their own problems. </p>",
            "<p>To build a powerful team of copywriters, however, growing your own team is a solid option. All it needs is identifying people with the right attitude, as well as interest/understanding of tech or business, then dedicating the time to teach and mentor them until they reach the required standard. </p>",
            "<p>This approach needs patience, plenty of coaching, and comprehensive feedback. As such, it’s a long-term strategy, and as time goes on, you’ll start to reap the rewards of your efforts in mentorship, training, and investment. </p>",
            "<p>Also, if a member of your marketing team has a flair for writing, you could structure a development program for them which would involve copywriting training so they can help out with the writing workload. One other advantage of this type of training is that they can review content that has been outsourced to freelance writers. </p>",
            "<p>Alternatively, for reliable and quick results, an expert copywriting agency is the best option. </p>",
            "<p>One thing you can be sure of is that you’ll be getting the best copywriters, which is exactly what B2B marketing requires. Even if you implement all the data, technology, automation, and personalisation techniques, you won’t be making any positive impact if you’re creating content that your readers find poor quality. </p>",

            "<p>A question on the tip of many people’s lips is: what’s the difference between content writing and copywriting? </p>",
            "<p>Generally, a content writer creates content like blog posts and articles. This forms part of a content marketing strategy to raise awareness for a brand, business, or product. Although the end goal is to sell, it’s a much less direct approach. </p>",
            "<p>In case you’re interested, we have a content writing service, too. </p>",
            "<p>Copywriters try to prompt buyers to take action and make a purchase straightaway. They might craft website pages, emails, or other kinds of promotional materials. To achieve success, it’s essential to study the arts of convincing and persuasion. </p>",
            "<p>There’s a lot of overlap between the two fields. Blog posts often contain a call to action (CTA) that prompts the reader to buy something, for instance. </p>",
            "<p>Don’t get too hung up about the labels – just focus on learning to write in a way that gets the results you want. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Master the basics of grammar</h4>",
            "<p>The natural follow-up question is: how can I learn to improve my copywriting? Before you perfect your persuasion skills, you need to get your basic grammar skills up to scratch. Grammarly is the most popular piece of grammar-checking software available, and it has a free version. ProWritingAid and HemingwayApp are two alternatives. </p>",
            "<p>Whichever you use, you’ll find there’s a focus on cutting out unnecessary words and making your writing as simple as possible. After using them for a few weeks, you might be surprised how many redundant words and phrases you’ve been using in your writing. </p>",
            "<p>If you still don’t feel confident in your writing or grammar skills, why not ask for a second opinion? Asking a friend or relative to proofread your work might sound daunting, but it will help you take huge strides in improving your writing </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Study copywriting tools and resources</h4>",
            "<p>Once you’ve mastered the basics of writing well, you should start thinking about your SEO strategy. It’s no use writing a fantastic piece of copy if it ranks so low on the search engine that nobody sees it. </p>",
            "<p>One tool we can’t recommend enough is WordCounter. Don’t be fooled by the name – it does far more than just count how many words you’re using. </p>",
            "<p>This website also recommends keywords based on your content and lets you know if you need to include more of them. This is essential for letting Google know what you’re writing about. </p>",
            "<p>Although it’s generally not a good idea to work backwards with your SEO strategy, this is a less intimidating way to start than carrying out keyword research before writing. </p>",
            "<p>Like all serious writers will tell you, you can’t improve your writing unless you read. Even if you think you don’t have the time, it’s time to make it a priority. Amongst the most acclaimed books on copywriting are The Boron Letters by Gary C Halbert, Ogilvy On Advertising by David Ogilvy, and Triggers by Joe Sugarman. They all contain useful copywriting examples, too. </p>",
            "<p>Of course, there are many more. As you’ll soon see, inspiration could strike you in strange places. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Take notes from inspiring writers</h4>",
            "<p>Reading books about copywriting and related topics is useful, but it’s not the only way to improve your copy. </p>",
            "<p>Becoming a truly great writer is all about developing flair and your own voice. That involves experimenting with your writing and consuming many types of content. </p>",
            "<p>Comedy, memoirs, and young adult fiction are all on the table. Maybe reading Charles Dickens helps you add some flow into your writing and trying some humour teaches you to be less formal and rigid. </p>",
            "<p>Whatever you’re reading, take notes and think about how you can learn from it. </p>",
            "<h4 class='title mb--30'>Don’t hold back with your editing process</h4>",
            "<p>Many people struggle with editing, but let’s get real – you can’t be a good writer without it. This is true of all kinds of writing, but you have to be especially ruthless with your copy. If your first sentence doesn’t hook the reader in immediately, you can kiss goodbye to your sales. </p>",
            "<p>If you’re struggling, a common tip is to read your content out loud. It might seem tedious, and you might feel slightly crazy doing it at first, but it’s one of the best ways to figure out if something sounds good. </p>",
            "<p>Copywriting is a difficult skill. You can’t just pick it up overnight after reading a book or watching a few videos. If you truly want to improve, you have to make a long-term commitment to mastering your craft. </p>",
            "<p>If you already have a business or an idea and you need to start making sales now, you might not feel you can afford to wait that long. That’s okay, too. A great alternative is to use a copywriting service that’s already put in the time and can do the work for you. You can also use working with an agency as the perfect opportunity to learn more about copywriting. </p>"
